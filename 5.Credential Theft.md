Once elevated on a machine, we can obtain credential material for other users who are authenticated.  Credentials can come in the form of plaintext (username & password), hashes (NTLM, AES, DCC, NetNTLM, etc), and Kerberos tickets.  

# CobaltStrike Beacon with mimikatz 

Cobalt Strike has a built-in version of Mimikatz that we can use to extract various credential types.  However, there are some differences with how it behaves in Beacon compared to the console version.  Each time you execute Mimikatz in Beacon, it does so in a new temporary process which is then destroyed.  This means you can't run two "related" commands, such as:

beacon> mimikatz token::elevate
beacon> mimikatz lsadump::sam

#### Chaining commands 

Since CS 4.8, you can chain multiple commands together by separating them with a semi-colon.

beacon> mimikatz token::elevate ; lsadump::sam

#### Modifiers
Beacon also has its own command convention using the ! and @ symbols as "modifiers".

The ! elevates Beacon to SYSTEM before running the given command, which is useful in cases where you're running in high-integrity but need to impersonate SYSTEM.  In most cases, ! is a direct replacement for token::elevate. For example:

beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::sam

The @ impersonates Beacon's thread token before running the given command, which is useful in cases where Mimikatz needs to interact with a remote system, such as with dcsync.  
This is also compatible with other impersonation primitives such as make_token and steal_token.  For example:

beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\bfarmer

beacon> make_token DEV\nlamb F3rrari
[+] Impersonated DEV\nlamb (netonly)

beacon> mimikatz @lsadump::dcsync /user:DEV\krbtgt
[DC] 'dev.cyberbotic.io' will be the domain
[DC] 'dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io' will be the DC server
[DC] 'DEV\krbtgt' will be the user account

[rpc] AuthnSvc : GSS_NEGOTIATE (9)

# NTLM Hashes 

The sekurlsa::logonpasswords Mimikatz module is infamous for being able to "dump plaintext passwords from memory".  Having a user's password has obvious advantages and was a lucrative tactic for a long time.  However, Microsoft have implemented a lot of mitigations in Windows 10 and above, such as disabling wdigest by default, so happening across plaintext passwords is certainly less common.

This module is still capable of retrieving NTLM hashes which is useful for pairing with the Pass the Hash or even cracking to recover the plaintext. This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !sekurlsa::logonpasswords

Cobalt Strike also has a short-hand command for this called logonpasswords.  After dumping these credentials, go to View > Credentials to see a copy of them.

This module will open a read handle to LSASS which can be logged under event 4656.  Use the "Suspicious Handle to LSASS" saved search in Kibana to see them.

# Kerberos Encryption Keys

The sekurlsa::ekeys Mimikatz module will dump the Kerberos encryption keys of currently logged on users.  Since most modern Windows services choose to use Kerberos over NTLM, leveraging these instead of NTLM hashes makes more sense for blending into normal authentication traffic.

These keys can be used in a variety of Kerberos abuse scenarios. This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !sekurlsa::ekeys

There is a known issue where Mimikatz may incorrectly label all of the hashes as des_cbc_md4.
In this case, the AES256 key is the one we want.  These hashes are not automatically populated into the Credential data model, but they can be added manually via View > Credentials > Add.
This module also opens a read handle to LSASS.

# Security Account Manager (SAM) 

The Security Account Manager (SAM) database holds the NTLM hashes of local accounts only.  These can be extracted with the lsadump::sam Mimikatz module.  If a common local administrator account is being used with the same password across an entire environment, this can make it very trivial to move laterally.
This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::sam

This module will open a handle to the SAM registry hive.  Use the "Suspicious SAM Hive Handle" saved search in Kibana to see them.

# Domain Cached Credentials (DCC)

Domain Cached Credentials (DCC) was designed for instances where domain credentials are required to logon to a machine, even whilst it's disconnected from the domain (think of a roaming laptop for example).  
The local device caches the domain credentials so authentication can happen locally, but these can be extracted and cracked offline to recover plaintext credentials.
