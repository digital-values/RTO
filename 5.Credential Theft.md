Once elevated on a machine, we can obtain credential material for other users who are authenticated.  Credentials can come in the form of plaintext (username & password), hashes (NTLM, AES, DCC, NetNTLM, etc), and Kerberos tickets.  

# CobaltStrike Beacon with mimikatz 

Cobalt Strike has a built-in version of Mimikatz that we can use to extract various credential types.  However, there are some differences with how it behaves in Beacon compared to the console version.  Each time you execute Mimikatz in Beacon, it does so in a new temporary process which is then destroyed.  This means you can't run two "related" commands, such as:

beacon> mimikatz token::elevate
beacon> mimikatz lsadump::sam

#### Chaining commands 

Since CS 4.8, you can chain multiple commands together by separating them with a semi-colon.

beacon> mimikatz token::elevate ; lsadump::sam

#### Modifiers
Beacon also has its own command convention using the ! and @ symbols as "modifiers".

The ! elevates Beacon to SYSTEM before running the given command, which is useful in cases where you're running in high-integrity but need to impersonate SYSTEM.  In most cases, ! is a direct replacement for token::elevate. For example:

beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::sam

The @ impersonates Beacon's thread token before running the given command, which is useful in cases where Mimikatz needs to interact with a remote system, such as with dcsync.  
This is also compatible with other impersonation primitives such as make_token and steal_token.  For example:

beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\bfarmer

beacon> make_token DEV\nlamb F3rrari
[+] Impersonated DEV\nlamb (netonly)

beacon> mimikatz @lsadump::dcsync /user:DEV\krbtgt

# NTLM Hashes 

The sekurlsa::logonpasswords Mimikatz module is infamous for being able to "dump plaintext passwords from memory".  Having a user's password has obvious advantages and was a lucrative tactic for a long time.  However, Microsoft have implemented a lot of mitigations in Windows 10 and above, such as disabling wdigest by default, so happening across plaintext passwords is certainly less common.

This module is still capable of retrieving NTLM hashes which is useful for pairing with the Pass the Hash or even cracking to recover the plaintext. This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !sekurlsa::logonpasswords

Cobalt Strike also has a short-hand command for this called logonpasswords.  After dumping these credentials, go to View > Credentials to see a copy of them.

This module will open a read handle to LSASS which can be logged under event 4656.  Use the "Suspicious Handle to LSASS" saved search in Kibana to see them.

# Kerberos Encryption Keys

The sekurlsa::ekeys Mimikatz module will dump the Kerberos encryption keys of currently logged on users.  Since most modern Windows services choose to use Kerberos over NTLM, leveraging these instead of NTLM hashes makes more sense for blending into normal authentication traffic.

These keys can be used in a variety of Kerberos abuse scenarios. This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !sekurlsa::ekeys

There is a known issue where Mimikatz may incorrectly label all of the hashes as des_cbc_md4.
In this case, the AES256 key is the one we want.  These hashes are not automatically populated into the Credential data model, but they can be added manually via View > Credentials > Add.
This module also opens a read handle to LSASS.

# Security Account Manager (SAM) 

The Security Account Manager (SAM) database holds the NTLM hashes of local accounts only.  These can be extracted with the lsadump::sam Mimikatz module.  If a common local administrator account is being used with the same password across an entire environment, this can make it very trivial to move laterally.
This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::sam

This module will open a handle to the SAM registry hive.  Use the "Suspicious SAM Hive Handle" saved search in Kibana to see them.

# Domain Cached Credentials (DCC)

Domain Cached Credentials (DCC) was designed for instances where domain credentials are required to logon to a machine, even whilst it's disconnected from the domain (think of a roaming laptop for example).  
The local device caches the domain credentials so authentication can happen locally, but these can be extracted and cracked offline to recover plaintext credentials.

Unfortunately, the hash format is not NTLM so it can't be used with pass the hash.  The only viable use for these is to crack them offline.

The lsadump::cache Mimikatz module can extract these from HKLM\SECURITY.
This command requires elevated privileges.

beacon> mimikatz !lsadump::cache

To crack these with hashcat, we need to transform them into the expected format. The example hashes page shows us it should be $DCC2$<iterations>#<username>#<hash>. DCC is orders of magnitude slower to crack than NTLM.

This module will open a handle to the SECURITY registry hive.  Use the "Suspicious SECURITY Hive Handle" saved search in Kibana to see them.

# Extracting Kerberos Tickets 

One unfortunate consequence of the aforementioned techniques is that they obtain handles to sensitive resources, which can be audited and logged quite easily.  Rubeus is a C# tool designed for Kerberos interaction and abuses, using legitimate Windows APIs.

Its triage command will list all the Kerberos tickets in your current logon session and if elevated, from all logon sessions on the machine.

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe triage

Each user has their own logon session, which is represented by a LUID (locally unique identifier).  In this example, we're operating within the LUID of bfarmer, 0x14b5fa.  The WKSN-2$ machine account has its own session, 0x3e4; and jking also has a session, 0x7049f.  Tickets for the service name krbtgt are Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) and others are Ticket Granting Service Tickets (TGSs).  The different ticket types are described in more detail in the Kerberos chapter.

Rubeus' dump command will extract these tickets from memory - but because it uses WinAPIs, it does not need to open suspicious handles to LSASS.  If not elevated, we can only pull tickets from our own session.  Without any further arguments, Rubeus will extract all tickets possible, but we can be more specific by using the /luid and /service parameters.

For example, if we only wanted the TGT for jking, we can do:

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe dump /luid:0x7049f /service:krbtgt

This will output the ticket(s) in base64 encoded format. You may also add the /nowrap option which will format the base64 encoding onto a single line - this makes copy & pasting much easier.

# DCSync 

The Directory Replication Service (MS-DRSR) protocol is used to synchronise and replicate Active Directory data between domain controllers.  DCSync is a technique which leverages this protocol to extract username and credential data from a DC. This requires GetNCChanges which is usually only available to domain admins.  The technique is included here for completeness, and it will be useful later on.

Beacon has a dedicated dcsync command, which calls mimikatz lsadump::dcsync in the background.

beacon> make_token DEV\nlamb F3rrari

beacon> dcsync dev.cyberbotic.io DEV\krbtgt

Here we have extracted the NTLM and AES keys for the krbtgt account using nlamb (a domain admin).

Directory replication can be detected if Directory Service Access auditing is enabled, by searching for 4662 events where the identifying GUID is 1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 (for DS-Replication-Get-Changes and DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All) or 89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c (DS-Replication-Get-Changes-In-Filtered-Set). Find these using the "Suspicious Directory Replication" saved search in Kibana.

Replication traffic usually only occurs between domain controllers but can also be seen via applications such as Azure AD Connect.  Mature organisations should baseline typical DRS traffic to find suspicious outliers.
