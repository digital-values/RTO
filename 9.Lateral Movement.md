Moving laterally between computers in a domain is important for accessing sensitive information/materials, and obtaining new credentials.  Cobalt Strike provides three strategies for executing Beacons/code/commands on remote targets.

The first and most convenient is to use the built-in jump command - the syntax is jump [method] [target] [listener].  Type jump to see a list of methods.  This will spawn a Beacon payload on the remote target, and if using a P2P listener, will connect to it automatically.
