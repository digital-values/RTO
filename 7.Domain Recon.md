This section will review some of the information you can enumerate from the current domain as a standard domain user. We'll cover many of these areas (e.g. domain trusts and GPO abuses) in much more detail when we get to those specific chapters. For now, we'll see some of the different tooling that can be used to query the domain, and how we can obtain targeted information.
It's worth noting that performing domain recon in a high integrity process is not required, and in some cases (such as SYSTEM) can be detrimental.

# PowerView 

PowerView has long been the de-facto tool for domain enumeration.  One of its biggest strengths is that the queries return proper PowerShell objects, which can be piped to other cmdlets.  This allows you to chain multiple commands together to form complex and powerful queries.

beacon> powershell-import C:\Tools\PowerSploit\Recon\PowerView.ps1

### Get-Domain

Returns a domain object for the current domain or the domain specified with -Domain. Useful information includes the domain name, the forest name and the domain controllers.
    
    beacon> powershell Get-Domain

### Get-DomainController

Returns the domain controllers for the current or specified domain.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainController | select Forest, Name, OSVersion | fl

### Get-ForestDomain

Returns all domains for the current forest or the forest specified by -Forest.

    beacon> powershell Get-ForestDomain

### Get-DomainPolicyData

Returns the default domain policy or the domain controller policy for the current domain or a specified domain/domain controller. Useful for finding information such as the domain password policy.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainPolicyData | select -expand SystemAccess

### Get-DomainUser

Return all (or specific) user(s). To only return specific properties, use -Properties. By default, all user objects for the current domain are returned, use -Identity to return a specific user.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainUser -Identity jking -Properties DisplayName, MemberOf | fl

    displayname : John King
    memberof    : {CN=Internet Users,CN=Users,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io, CN=Support 
              Engineers,CN=Users,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io}

This shows that jking is a member of the Support Engineers group.  Most privileges in a domain are delegated to domain groups, rather than individual users.  So if we can find where this domain group has privileged access, we know that members will also have those privileges.
- If you run this command without the -Identity parameter, prepare to wait a while for all the data to return.

### Get-DomainComputer

Return all computers or specific computer objects.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainComputer -Properties DnsHostName | sort -Property DnsHostName

### Get-DomainOU

Search for all organization units (OUs) or specific OU objects.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainOU -Properties Name | sort -Property Name

### Get-DomainGroup

Return all domain groups or specific domain group objects.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainGroup | where Name -like "*Admins*" | select SamAccountName

### Get-DomainGroupMember

Return the members of a specific domain group.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" | select MemberDistinguishedName

### Get-DomainGPO

Return all Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or specific GPO objects. To enumerate all GPOs that are applied to a particular machine, use -ComputerIdentity.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainGPO -Properties DisplayName | sort -Property DisplayName

### Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup

Returns all GPOs that modify local group membership through Restricted Groups or Group Policy Preferences.  You can then manually find which OUs, and by extension which computers, these GPOs apply to.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup | select GPODisplayName, GroupName
    GPODisplayName     GroupName            
    --------------     ---------            
    Workstation Admins DEV\Support Engineers
    Server Admins      DEV\Support Engineers

This shows that the Support Engineers group is being assigned some sort of local access to the machines to which these GPOs apply. Although the GPO naming convention suggests this is local admin access, it may also be a different localgroup such as Remote Desktop Users.

### Get-DomainGPOUserLocalGroupMapping

Enumerates the machines where a specific domain user/group is a member of a specific local group.  This is useful for finding where domain groups have local admin access, which is a more automated way to perform the manual cross-referencing described above.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainGPOUserLocalGroupMapping -LocalGroup Administrators | select ObjectName, GPODisplayName, ContainerName, ComputerName | fl
    ObjectName     : Support Engineers
    GPODisplayName : Server Admins
    ContainerName  : {OU=Servers,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io}
    ComputerName   : {web.dev.cyberbotic.io, sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io, fs.dev.cyberbotic.io}
    
    ObjectName     : Support Engineers
    GPODisplayName : Workstation Admins
    ContainerName  : {OU=Workstations,DC=dev,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io}
    ComputerName   : {wkstn-1.dev.cyberbotic.io, wkstn-2.dev.cyberbotic.io}

This output confirms that the Support Engineers domain group is a member of the local Administrators group on machines: web, sql-2, fs, wkstn-1 and wkstn-2.

### 
Get-DomainTrust

Return all domain trusts for the current or specified domain.

    beacon> powershell Get-DomainTrust

# SharpView

SharpView was designed to be a C# port of PowerView and therefore has much the same functionality.  However, one downside is that it doesn't have the same piping ability as PowerShell.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpView\SharpView\bin\Release\SharpView.exe Get-Domain

# ADSearch

ADSearch has fewer built-in searches compared to PowerView and SharpView, but it does allow you to specify custom Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) searches.  These can be used to identify entries in the directory that match a given criteria.

For example, we can search for all objects whose category is "user" (i.e. domain users).

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\ADSearch\ADSearch\bin\Release\ADSearch.exe --search "objectCategory=user"

Filters can be used to limit the search result further.  For instance, search for all domain groups which end in the word "admins".

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\ADSearch\ADSearch\bin\Release\ADSearch.exe --search "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=*Admins))"

These can be made more complex with further AND, OR and NOT conditions.  All attributes can be returned using the --full parameter, or specific attributes with the --attributes parameter.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\ADSearch\ADSearch\bin\Release\ADSearch.exe --search "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=MS SQL Admins))" --attributes cn,member

Additionally, the --json parameter can be used to format the output in JSON.
