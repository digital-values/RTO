*Getting Started* 


MANDIANT CYBER KILL CHAIN 


    Initial Reconnaissance - research the target systems and employees to develop a methodology for the intrusion.
    Initial Compromise - execute malicious code on one or more targets via the attack vector planned during phase 1.
    Establish Foothold - maintain continued control over a compromised system by installing persistent backdoors.
    Escalate Privileges - exploit system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to obtain local admin access to compromised systems.
    Internal Reconnaissance - explore the target's internal infrastructure and environment.
    Move Laterally - use credentials obtained from phase 4 to compromise additional systems.
    Maintain Presence - maintain highly privileged access to domains and systems.
    Complete Mission - accomplish the operational objective.



*ENGAGEMENT PLANNING* 

Define scope:

should be geared towards building a scenario for the engagement


Threat Model:
Align a company's realisitic attacksurface 
- red team must build a threat profile once threat has been identified (MITRE ATTCK)

Breach Model:
if not assumed breach, have backups incase initial access cannot be achieved in the first defined time period 
Red team assessments are more about detection and response rather than prevention 
-need to gain compromise within -25% of engagement timeframe 


Notifications and Announcements:
no notification allows for more authentic outcomes 
could lead to bad relationships because security might feel like they are being "tested"

Rules of Engagement:

The RoE should:

    Define the engagement objectives.
    Define the target(s) of the engagement, including domains and IP ranges.
    Identify any legal or regulatory requirements and/or restrictions.
    Contain emergency contact lists for key persons in all parties.

All parties must consent and agree on the RoE! 

Physical Red Teams should have a "Get out of Jail Letter"  >>> need to prove they were acting in accordance with company permission


Record Keeping and Deconfliction:
The use of terminal auto-logging and screen recording (e.g. record your screen at 1FPS) software can be useful to facilitate this.
Cobalt Strike has documentation option 

Data Handling:
Avoid viewing sensitive data (HIPAA PII ETC) unless stated in scope/obj

Duration:
Determined after scope and objectives have been agreed, average is 4 weeks.

Costs:
It's easy to forget factoring in the cost of activities that come prior to and after an engagement.  
That includes this whole planning process, pre-engagement meetings, threat profiling, research, tool customisations, infrastructure setup and so on. 
Post-engagement wash-up meetings and other follow-up meetings should also be considered.
